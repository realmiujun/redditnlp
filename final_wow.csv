the answer is pretty difficult. if you go with older lore, this has always been possible. there is a duality to light &amp; shadow the same way there is between life &amp; death. they both depend on each other because each only exists in contrast to the other. 

back in cata and a bit here and there onwards, the twilight dragons and specifically the twilight's hammer cult dabbled in that sort of thing. in the dungeon hour of twilight, the final boss benedictus wields both light and shadow. further along into legion, the entire discipline priest spec's lore is about combining shadow and light. their artifact weapon, light's wrath, is a vessel of both light and shadow and intertwines both. the priest order hall is also an intertwining of light and shadow. 

if you go with newer lore, all we have is a short story about how turalyon, a lightforged human, can no longer touch his void elf wife because of the opposing forces of light and shadow they possesses. nowhere else has the combining of light and shadow ever been an issue, but for some reason the writers felt the need to establish this contradictory plot thread on the heels of all the new disc priest lore and the naaru lore with the crucible on the vindicaar of the final patch of legion. 

&gt;also why aren't shadow casters such as shadow priest and warlock more influenced by the corruption and buffed, considering it's their domain? 

this is likely the case, we just don't have any warlocks of shadow priests central to the story at the moment. alleria is (as far as i'm aware, still doing the alliance side of stuff) probably as close as we have in the current arch, but she is absent from this patch save for a boss encounter in stormwind's vision, in which she *is* supped up. so there's that i suppose.

we also have anduin being affected rather adversely to the n'zoth vibes, but he isn't a shadow priest and it's likely *everybody* is being affected this way and anduin is just used as an example to showcase this, him being a priest is probably coincidental. 

other than that, you can probably say all the humanoid n'zoth cultists are shadow priests and *have* been supped up quite a bit due to his rising. 

&gt;edit: what the hell? downvotes? for asking a question about lore? smh

despite you saying ""lore wise,"" people like a certain poop finger painter have trouble with reading comprehension and assumed when you said, 

&gt;why aren't shadow casters such as shadow priest and warlock more influenced by the corruption and buffed, considering it's their domain?

that your entire post was specifically about gameplay and *not* lore, so your question looks like some sort of weird ""hey how come blizzard didn't block the paladin class, two specs of the priest, and the entire lightforged draenei race from doing any void related content?"" 

i'm not sure why anyone would seriously ask that and preface it with ""lore wise,"" but apparently some people do and downvoted accordingly while smuggly suggesting you don't overthink the gameplay you weren't asking about. ;)",wow,0.3552349511565944,angry

&gt;  
&gt;the sun is made of fire.

false, the sun is composed of hydrogen and helium and exists in a plasma state, since fire cannot exist within a vacuum.  however, for the sake of argument, i'll pretend it's true.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;an'she is the sun, and can channel the light.

false. an'she is the tauren interpretation of the sun according to their *beliefs*, not the physical sun itself.  they *believe* that the sun is called an'she, and was the right eye of the earth mother which was ripped out and thrown into the sky, just as mu'sha is the moon and the left eye of the earth mother.  however, just because they believe it does not make it physically so.  they gain their power from the *belief*, not the physical object.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;fire elementals with an affinity for an'she or that come from an'she give did the light.

fire elementals do not have an affinity for an'she, for an'she is a tauren concept.  furthermore, there is no existing lore which ties the elemental plane of fire, or fire elementals at all for that matter, to azeroth's sun.  

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;cite for me one piece of canonical lore that proves the above can't happen. and i'm talking about an actual quote, not re

*before the storm, chapter 13*.  ""\[anduin's\] mind went back to the netherlight temple. *the* ***light*** *finds us,* he thought. *all of us. it chooses the story, or the face, or the name, or the song that resonates the most with each of us. we may call it* ***elune****, or* ***an'she****, or just the* ***light****, but it doesn't matter. we can turn away from it if we desire, but it's always there.*"" 

an'she, like elune, the naaru, etc, is another source of ***light***, not fire.

&gt;the entire unlock scenario is about preventing over-zealous worshippers from bringing back ragnaros. fire elementals call dark irons ""child of fire"". this is why they were enemies for most of wow. 

yeah, a rogue sect of worshippers, not the clan as a whole.  the dwarves in the unlock scenario are only worshipping ragnaros because they view moira as a weak leader.  again, they never truly worshipped ragnaros or fire elementals as a group.  here are some sources:

*chronicle: vol 3, page 116 (*a section literally titled ""the suffering of the dark irons""):

* the survivng dark irons carved out a stronghold in its \[blackrock mountain's\] depths called shadowforge city. **for generations, they were forced to serve ragnaros and his lieutenants.**
* emperor dagran thaurissan, a descendant of the long-dead sorcerer-thane, now ruld the dark irons on behalf of the firelord.  a charismatic but hard leader, **he bristled at his servitude** but delighted in the power ragnaros had bestowed upon him.
* when ragnaros ordered dagran to prepare the dark irons for a new war, **the emperor was overjoyed**.  he had long dreamed of conquering the other dwarf clans, not only to rule over them but **to wield their combined power in order to break free of the firelord's control.**

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;and also why none of the player characters are dark shaman. so, your entire tangent about dark shaman is entirely irrelevant. 

elemental shamans have a talent called ascendance, where they ""transform into a flame ascendant.""  lore-wise, in order to become an ascendant, *""they are infused with elemental powers, transforming them into monstrosities.*[*\[3\]*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/elemental_ascendant#cite_note-3) *the ascension process seems to involve draining something from other elementals*[*\[4\]*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/elemental_ascendant#cite_note-4) *or demigods.*[*\[5\]*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/elemental_ascendant#cite_note-5) *""*  

in regards to your previous statement regarding the cult of ragnaros trying to resurrect him, none of the player characters are ""over-zealous worshippers"" trying to ""bring back ragnaros."" so, your entire tangent about fire-worshipping player character pseudo-paladins is irrelevant.

and if you want to get into the logistics of a planet being pierced with an object that large, *if azeroth were a planet* which it isn't, then not only would the initial impact have been apocalyptic, the planet's internal geothermic activity would be disrupted if not completely ruined which is necessary for a magnetic field and an atmosphere to exist.

additionally, sargeras piercing the planet with the sword should've displaced enough atmosphere to send significant amount of gases into space, causing all of azeroth's atmosphere to permanently thin globally disrupting climate and ecosystems.

[],1,"&gt;i know that's what i'm saying. to complete that quest, you literally dont have to kill the dragons. that was an achievement that was later removed. there is no reason to kill them.

it doesn't matter if you have to or don't have to. the point is the quest was designed with the intent of making it completely within rational behavior of the pc to kill them, for ""no reason"" as you agree.

therefore, it is canon that the dk champion is perfectly capable of killing red dragons for no reason, other than to kill them. whether he does or doesn't isn't the point - the point is that it's perfectly within his moral compass to do so.

&gt;and you're right, being a powerful paladin isnt necessary to be a powerful death knight. but a lot of the greatest death knights have been paladins.

only because the initial dks were paladins. if the initial dks had all been normal warriors, then a lot of the greatest dks would've been warriors. the fact that there were a lot of paladins was just the way things played out, and had nothing to do with them being paladins.

&gt;the whole ebon blade schtick is basically ""fuck honor we'll do what's best to save the planet."" that's what ""we do what the living cannot,"" means.

once again, raising a red dragon and trying to raise tirion are neither the objectively best ways to save the planet.

they are the best ways to get whatever the ebon blade wants without concern for anyone else.

sociopathy doesn't mean evil or that they can't be trying to save the planet. this is how sociopathy is described:

&gt;antisocial personality disorder is defined by a pervasive and persistent disregard for morals, social norms, and the rights and feelings of others. individuals with this personality disorder will typically have no compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure and frequently manipulate and deceive other people, achieving this through wit and a façade of superficial charm or through intimidation and violence. they may display arrogance, think lowly and negatively of others, and lack remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude to those they have harmed.

there is no **lore wise** reason. blizzard has been categorically inconsistent with the lore surrounding light and void intermingling. alleria and turalyon not being able to touch was a cool throw-away plot thread that retconned the twilights, disc priest lore, the crucible, and a host of other things and will continue to confuse everyone as they soldier onward. for the second bit, shadow priests and warlocks likely do interact differently with the corruption permeating everything, but there aren't any central warlock or shadow priest characters at the moment. anduin seems to be affected by it but as far as we can tell that might just be everybody and not specifically related to him being a priest. 

of *course* from a gameplay perspective it would be a matter of developing peculiar interactions based on spec of class, but it's pretty clear for anyone who *reads his comment or grasps it at all* that when avgvstvs starts off his comment with, ""how come all light casters/users are able to still wield light when they are affected by the corruption of the void"" it's pretty obvious he isn't asking, ""how come blizz didn't disable the paladin class, one and a half specs of the priest, and the entire lightforged race while adding bonuses to shadow priests and warlocks?""  

tip: if what you're about to argue against sounds absurd, maybe ask them to clarify. turns out, not skipping over the first two words of his post would probably assist in making a response. 

on account of some trouble with reading comprehension, i'll break down how my original comment response to your post for you:

you wrote:

&gt;some things simply get handwaved because they don’t fit in the lore

i wrote:

&gt;blizzard usually does the exact opposite

by which i mean, instead of introducing gameplay which contradicts lore and dismissing it (which is fine), they introduce lore that contradicts already existing lore and gameplay, for seemingly no reason. and then just kind of go with it.

for example, *again*, alleria and turalyon not being able to touch. in an expansion that *just* introduced a host of disc priests with stories about intermingling light and shadow and light's wrath as their artifact. in a class hall where light and shadow ""twist about one another."" several expansions after we did the whole ""light + shadow = twilight?!"" thing. 

you wrote: 

&gt;blizzard can absolutely say “turalyon and alleria are a married couple who can’t even touch each other because they’re light and shadow, respectively” while also introducing a playable void elf class that can also be a holy priest and wear void corrupted gear,

yes that's fine, until-

&gt;..and still be consistent. 

they have not. it isn't consistent. at all. light's wrath is inconsistent. canon disc priest figures are inconsistent. the twilights and archbishop benedictus are inconsistent. they could have avoided every inconsistency (*including* the gameplay ones, if you insist on bringing up gameplay at all) by leaving out that turalyon and alleria can't touch. 

which is why i wrote,

&gt;why not just leave the whole void and light thing interacting off the table? leave it opened ended, make it a mystery, or simply say ""sure they work, it's called twilight stuff and we have an entire flight of dragons and cult about it! remember that archbishop benedictus and his whole light-and-shadow thing?""

is this at all making more sense to you? the rest of your post with regards to blizzard and the suspension of lore in lieu of gameplay i have no issue with - although you were arguing a point that didn't need to be argued. 

&gt;what would you have them do -

not create new lore (which currently serves no purpose until probably a void expansion, who knows how far into the future) that contradicts old lore *and* more new lore that just occurred. 

&gt;allow void elves to be priests, but only shadow spec? let lf draenei be priests, but only holy?

i wasn't implying that. /u/avgvstvs wasn't implying that. nobody was implying that. nobody brought up gameplay until *you* did, and then proceeded to complain your tangent on gameplay wasn't being grasped while never understanding the post you were replying to in the first place. magnificent. truly. 

avgvstvs wrote:

&gt;edit: what the hell? downvotes? **for asking a question about lore?** smh

gunna go out on a limb and assume that was your doing. ;)
he's in the positives now anyway, it would appear other people were able to *read and grasp* that ""lore wise"" meant ""lore wise"" and not ""gameplay."" imagine that!",wow,0.280888433997248,angry

they literally are anti-heroes. all 3 classes are punisher style anti-heroes.

no it doesn't. the other champions will not murder dragons or paladins to save the world. they wont ritualistically sacrifice unwilling people for their cause. nor will they do it with willing people.

play the damn order hall campaign. 

&amp;#x200b;

you are so fucking wrong here it hurts. not only do they know the place is sanctified (they fought and lost there back under arthas, and he  couldn't do shit to tyrion there.) but darion dies. he literally kills himself to save the deathlord and the horsemen. so if you count getting just fine as, having your troops die, having your deathlord and newly raised horsemen, who are all old heroes almost die, and having the main person of their order die, while also failing your objective, then sure, they got out just ""fine"".

&amp;#x200b;

"" ...no i don't? i literally spent the comment explaining why they don't want to fight the paladins. ""

saying self preservation non stop means nothing. as i said, by your logic, star wars has no heroes, everyone is a sociopath. you have yet to show sociopathic tendencies from the dk orderhall, while i keep pointing out how they have done non sociopathic things, and you try to hand wave or just keep repeating yourself. infact, all you have done is show you know nothing about what the dks and dhs are about and that you either paid no attention to their storylines, or flat out never played them.

"" the strongest paladin on azeroth was able to kill the strongest death knight on azeroth with one sword strike. ""

&amp;#x200b;

who is dead, and they are trying to bring back to save azeroth. they are literally risking their lives against allies, because they feel empathy and know how the paladins act. they wanted to be swift get in, grab tyrion, get out. if they felt no empathy they would be trying to raise all of the paladins, or destroy the place and resurrect the corpses.

&amp;#x200b;

"" taking a small in-game meme moment as a cornerstone of your lore argument means your argument doesn't have merit. ""

you literally have no grounds in your argument. and yes, it does add merit to my argument, because it shows emotion and empathy from one of the leaders of the scourge.

cite for me one piece of canonical lore that proves the above can't happen.

and also why none of the player characters are dark shaman. so, your entire tangent about dark shaman is entirely irrelevant. 

&gt; instead uses some sort of facsimile based on the incorrect belief that they worship fire elementals.

dude what? that's the core of their entire lore. the entire unlock scenario is about preventing over-zealous worshippers from bringing back ragnaros. fire elementals call dark irons ""child of fire"".",wow,0.5388371264814628,angry

literally in the class description of paladin.  all paladins are holy warriors that gain powers and blessings from the light, and i'm talking lore-wise and not just ingame mechanics.

* draenei paladins gained their power and connection to the light by naaru.
* human paladins started out as clerics of the holy order of northshire clerics, aka priests who trained in martial combat to better protect themselves.
* dwarves were trained as paladins by humans.
* high elves also believed in the holy light, and paladins likely existed before exposure to the human and dwarven order of the silver hand (high elf paladins still exist, serving the silver covenant)
* blood elf paladins received their power by siphoning the light energy of mu'ru, an imprisoned naaru (again, a being of light).  later, they draw their energy from the restored sunwell, which is now infused with the light.
* tauren paladins, aka sunwalkers, receive their powers by drawing the light energy from an'she, the sun.
* zandalari paladins, aka prelates, draw their power from worship and belief in rezan, the holy loa of kings.  it is unknown what connection rezan has with the light, but it does exist.
* the few night elf paladins receive their light connection through elune, who velen believes may be a naaru.

trying to suggest that dark iron paladins are not actual paladins, but receive ""light-like abilities"" from fire elementals is absurd.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;also, shaman are different. shaman get their powers by cooperating and bargaining with elementals. paladins get their power through pure belief. the former is a relationship of peers. the latter is a relationship of subservience.

dark shaman gain their powers by binding and enslaving elements, using the powers of decay, and not cooperating or bargaining.  this is how the kor'kron shaman retained their powers, and why thrall was unable to commune with the elements when he confronted garrosh (they had been forced from the area).

furthermore, belief is not a ""relationship of subservience.""  subservience is the ""willingness to obey others unquestionably.""  tirion fordring broke his vows and was exiled from the order of the silver hand for saving eitrigg's life.  he even retained his light-given abilities even after uther performed a ceremony to strip him of them, further proving that it is not a ""relationship of subservience.""

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;if a dark iron dwarf were to fervently worship a powerful fire elemental, who rewards the did with searing powers thanks to his belief, that has far more similarities to a paladin than a shaman.

dark iron dwarves never *worshipped* fire elementals. the entire clan was enslaved by ragnaros and his minions when sorceror-thane thaurissan accidentally summoned ragnaros during the war of the three hammers.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i think you're interpreting game mechanics into lore too rigidly.

and i think you're lacking a basic grasp of lore altogether, if you believe that out of every paladin race in the game, dark irons are the only ones who do not use light or holy magic (which is literally the only thing that makes a paladin a paladin), and instead uses some sort of facsimile based on the incorrect belief that they worship fire elementals.",wow,0.5637623401219379,angry

if the **very slightly higher** difficulty of fighting alleria in melee is a problem for you, that's an issue with your skill. to anyone of moderate skill, that difference will never make or break your success in that fight, especially since the workaround is a very simple los trick.

that's certainly your call, but if you are someone who is not overly interested in bfa pvp, one requires many 10s of hours of terrible grinding, and the other one involves a couple hours of arenas and then random pve activities that take less than half an hour a week...i would say cns is orders of magnitudes more palatable.

pretty much every essence has been time-gated otherwise, so cns is really no exception in that regard.

if they patch and hotfix the current abysmal imbalance that certain corruption traits in the maintenance tomorrow, it will provide the least fallout. sure, some people have already acquired heroic gear and pvp rating easier, but this now falls more in line with the general player approach of, ""do the thing before it's patched/exploit early exploit often"", the latter i don't condone, but has been evidenced in the past that players will do it. especially when an exploit would give you a punishment in a ban less than the time it would take to achieve the exploited goal.

should corruption *not* be addressed at all and remains the same going into mythic tomorrow, this might signal to us that corruption is working as blizzard now intends, despite nerfs already applied to certain overpowered traits beforehand. it'll become a legion legendary situation without the later patch catch-up of purchasing them--people will take people that have the gear that benefits them most, especially in dps checks, *because* of the gear giving someone a 9k dps edge over someone of equal skill alone, especially when the item is a 410 world quest ring. that shouldn't fucking happen.

and finally, the most heinous path blizzard can take, is to hotfix it or patch it *after* mythic goes live. should a high end guild like method or limit kill a boss such as maut, which has a dps check, and *then* corruption is *fixed* to a point that goal is no longer as achievable, heads are going to roll. hell, if even wrathion goes down with someone in those top dps slots pulling amazing damage because of an outlandishly op corruption trait, that precedent is set, and you'd be, to some people, favoring that first guild because they beat the boss before *they* were nerfed, rather than the other way around.

but at this point i'm beginning to ramble. there are some other solutions i'm sure but corruption was not tested and handled well enough for live. it's an interesting system on paper, and i enjoy aspects of it, but live? it's not as smooth as i'd like for the whole of the game.",wow,0.2719980663535753,angry
