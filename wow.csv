Mythic - the hardest difficulty, suited for progression / competitive guilds. Fixed at 20 man size.

I haven't played FFXIV but Mythic raiding is extremely challenging. It's common for the world-first race (eg. the best players in the world) to spend hundreds of attempts to kill the last boss of each tier.

"[{'a': ':monk:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/1xf0739ubas21_t5_2qio8/monk'}]",1,"&gt;Lore wise, how come all Light casters/users are able to still wield Light when they are affected by the corruption of the Void?

The answer is pretty difficult. If you go with older lore, this has always been possible. There is a duality to light &amp; shadow the same way there is between life &amp; death. They both depend on each other because each only exists in contrast to the other. 

Back in Cata and a bit here and there onwards, the Twilight dragons and specifically the Twilight's Hammer cult dabbled in that sort of thing. In the dungeon Hour of Twilight, the final boss Benedictus wields both light and shadow. Further along into Legion, the entire discipline priest spec's lore is about combining shadow and light. Their artifact weapon, Light's Wrath, is a vessel of both light and shadow and intertwines both. The priest order hall is also an intertwining of light and shadow. 

If you go with newer lore, all we have is a short story about how Turalyon, a lightforged human, can no longer touch his void elf wife because of the opposing forces of light and shadow they possesses. Nowhere else has the combining of light and shadow ever been an issue, but for some reason the writers felt the need to establish this contradictory plot thread on the heels of all the new disc priest lore and the naaru lore with the crucible on the Vindicaar of the final patch of Legion. 

&gt;Also why aren't shadow casters such as Shadow Priest and Warlock more influenced by the corruption and buffed, considering it's their domain? 

This is likely the case, we just don't have any warlocks of shadow priests central to the story at the moment. Alleria is (as far as I'm aware, still doing the Alliance side of stuff) probably as close as we have in the current arch, but she is absent from this patch save for a boss encounter in Stormwind's vision, in which she *is* supped up. So there's that I suppose.

We also have Anduin being affected rather adversely to the N'zoth vibes, but he isn't a shadow priest and it's likely *everybody* is being affected this way and Anduin is just used as an example to showcase this, him being a priest is probably coincidental. 

Other than that, you can probably say all the humanoid N'zoth cultists are shadow priests and *have* been supped up quite a bit due to His rising. 

&gt;Edit: What the hell? Downvotes? For asking a question about lore? SMH

Despite you saying ""lore wise,"" people like a certain poop finger painter have trouble with reading comprehension and assumed when you said, 

&gt;why aren't shadow casters such as Shadow Priest and Warlock more influenced by the corruption and buffed, considering it's their domain?

that your entire post was specifically about gameplay and *not* lore, so your question looks like some sort of weird ""hey how come blizzard didn't block the paladin class, two specs of the priest, and the entire lightforged draenei race from doing any void related content?"" 

I'm not sure why anyone would seriously ask that and preface it with ""lore wise,"" but apparently some people do and downvoted accordingly while smuggly suggesting you don't overthink the gameplay you weren't asking about. ;)",wow

"[{'a': ':paladin:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/uvkv4eutbas21_t5_2qio8/paladin'}]",1,"&gt;Not really hard to twist. Here's perfectly compatible logic I came up with in 5 seconds:  
&gt;  
&gt;The sun is made of fire.

False, the sun is composed of hydrogen and helium and exists in a plasma state, since fire cannot exist within a vacuum.  However, for the sake of argument, I'll pretend it's true.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;An'she is the sun, and can channel the Light.

False. An'she is the Tauren interpretation of the Sun according to their *beliefs*, not the physical sun itself.  They *believe* that the Sun is called An'she, and was the Right Eye of the Earth Mother which was ripped out and thrown into the sky, just as Mu'sha is the Moon and the Left Eye of the Earth Mother.  However, just because they believe it does not make it physically so.  They gain their power from the *belief*, not the physical object.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fire elementals with an affinity for An'she or that come from An'she give DID the Light.

Fire elementals do not have an affinity for An'she, for An'she is a Tauren concept.  Furthermore, there is no existing lore which ties the Elemental Plane of Fire, or Fire elementals at all for that matter, to Azeroth's sun.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Cite for me one piece of canonical lore that proves the above can't happen. And I'm talking about an actual quote, not re

*Before the Storm, Chapter 13*.  ""\[Anduin's\] mind went back to the Netherlight Temple. *The* ***Light*** *finds us,* he thought. *All of us. It chooses the story, or the face, or the name, or the song that resonates the most with each of us. We may call it* ***Elune****, or* ***An'she****, or just the* ***Light****, but it doesn't matter. We can turn away from it if we desire, but it's always there.*"" 

An'she, like Elune, the Naaru, etc, is another source of ***Light***, not Fire.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The entire unlock scenario is about preventing over-zealous worshippers from bringing back Ragnaros. Fire elementals call Dark Irons ""child of fire"". This is why they were enemies for most of WoW. 

Yeah, a rogue sect of worshippers, not the clan as a whole.  The dwarves in the unlock scenario are only worshipping Ragnaros because they view Moira as a weak leader.  Again, they NEVER truly worshipped Ragnaros or Fire Elementals as a group.  Here are some sources:

*Chronicle: Vol 3, page 116 (*a section literally titled ""The Suffering of the Dark Irons""):

* The survivng Dark Irons carved out a stronghold in its \[Blackrock Mountain's\] depths called Shadowforge City. **For generations, they were forced to serve Ragnaros and his lieutenants.**
* Emperor Dagran Thaurissan, a descendant of the long-dead sorcerer-thane, now ruld the Dark Irons on behalf of the Firelord.  A charismatic but hard leader, **he bristled at his servitude** but delighted in the power Ragnaros had bestowed upon him.
* When Ragnaros ordered Dagran to prepare the Dark Irons for a new war, **the emperor was overjoyed**.  He had long dreamed of conquering the other dwarf clans, not only to rule over them but **to wield their combined power in order to break free of the Firelord's control.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And also why none of the player characters are Dark Shaman. So, your entire tangent about Dark Shaman is entirely irrelevant. 

Elemental shamans have a talent called Ascendance, where they ""transform into a flame ascendant.""  Lore-wise, in order to become an Ascendant, *""they are infused with elemental powers, transforming them into monstrosities.*[*\[3\]*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Elemental_ascendant#cite_note-3) *The ascension process seems to involve draining something from other elementals*[*\[4\]*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Elemental_ascendant#cite_note-4) *or demigods.*[*\[5\]*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Elemental_ascendant#cite_note-5) *""*  

In regards to your previous statement regarding the Cult of Ragnaros trying to resurrect him, none of the player characters are ""over-zealous worshippers"" trying to ""bring back Ragnaros."" So, your entire tangent about Fire-worshipping player character pseudo-Paladins is irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You're getting pretty aggressive about this. Is your day going okay?

But also it's not a planet. It's an egg for a living creature, a living creature that clearly has emotions, speaks and bleeds. We've been using its blood to power ourselves up this whole expansion.

And if you want to get into the logistics of a planet being pierced with an object that large, *if Azeroth were a planet* which it isn't, then not only would the initial impact have been apocalyptic, the planet's internal geothermic activity would be disrupted if not completely ruined which is necessary for a magnetic field and an atmosphere to exist.

Additionally, Sargeras piercing the planet with the sword should've displaced enough atmosphere to send significant amount of gases into space, causing all of Azeroth's atmosphere to permanently thin globally disrupting climate and ecosystems. 

So you can either treat Azeroth like a physical planet, or you can treat it like the living thing it is in lore. Either way, the consequences for the sword have been greatly underwhelming.",wow

It doesn't matter if you have to or don't have to. The point is the quest was designed with the intent of making it completely within rational behavior of the PC to kill them, for ""no reason"" as you agree.

Therefore, it is canon that the DK Champion is perfectly capable of killing red dragons for no reason, other than to kill them. Whether he does or doesn't isn't the point - the point is that it's perfectly within his moral compass to do so.

Only because the initial DKs were Paladins. If the initial DKs had all been normal Warriors, then a lot of the greatest DKs would've been Warriors. The fact that there were a lot of Paladins was just the way things played out, and had nothing to do with them being Paladins.

&gt;The whole ebon blade schtick is basically ""fuck honor we'll do what's best to save the planet."" That's what ""we do what the living cannot,"" means.

Once again, raising a red dragon and trying to raise Tirion are neither the objectively best ways to save the planet.

They are the best ways to get whatever the Ebon Blade wants without concern for anyone else.

Sociopathy doesn't mean evil or that they can't be trying to save the planet. This is how sociopathy is described:

&gt;Antisocial personality disorder is defined by a pervasive and persistent disregard for morals, social norms, and the rights and feelings of others. Individuals with this personality disorder will typically have no compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure and frequently manipulate and deceive other people, achieving this through wit and a façade of superficial charm or through intimidation and violence. They may display arrogance, think lowly and negatively of others, and lack remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude to those they have harmed.

This doesn't mean this is the *only* way they're capable of thinking. This doesn't mean they can only be harmful people. But this absolutely describes the instinct of how Death Knights think and act.",wow

These people generally understand Mac better either because they had one in college or the luxury effect makes learning to use it more interesting.

They also had the option to significantly reduce the cost to the company by buying it from the company at the end of life cycle because Macbook have historically held value better. This all makes sense and isn't shocking, but the lead is somewhat buried. 

They developed a custom deployment to make it viable. This could be a very effective new lead-in to the enterprise market if Apple worked with IBM to push it. The issue is that Macs are generally bothersome to incorporate into an enterprise environment because they're harder to centrally control. If IT has them, whatever because they're supposed to be safe. If an end user has them, I better make sure to have an Apple server running and someone to configure that, and a new set of higher paid service desk that can troubleshoot Macs.

When we're killing boars to level up to defeat threats to Azeroth, that's ""killing for Azeroth"".

&gt;DHs will torture, ritualistically sac, and commit suicide for their cause.

So do lots of other people on Azeroth. Plenty of quests involve the PC or NPC allies torturing. There's so much torture in quests it's ridiculous.

Also I don't see how committing suicide makes them anti-heroes. They don't hurt anyone but themselves when they commit suicide. That's pretty heroic.

Bro, I mained a DK through all of Legion. I did play the Order Hall Campaign. Like I said, going to the Chapel is long-term self-preservation. Lose a battle, win the war.

&gt;Saying self preservation non stop means nothing. As I said, by your logic, Star Wars has no heroes, everyone is a sociopath.

Nah, not really, because all of the Star Wars heroes have clear moral lines they won't cross. Death Knights don't. The only lines they don't cross are the ones that put them in existential danger. Like warring with Paladins.

&gt;You have yet to show Sociopathic tendencies from the DK orderhall, while I keep pointing out how they have done non sociopathic things, and you try to hand wave or just keep repeating yourself.

 Had you, you would note he asks about specifically about the lore. 

Gameplay is a question you decided to answer that was never asked, which is one of the reasons I even wrote ""to be fair to OP"" - because you never even *answered* his question, you responded with a tangent on gameplay and, in a spectacular demonstration of how warriors make no use of the intellect stat but apparently irony, patronized him with a ""don't over think it"". 

/u/Avgvstvs wrote: 

&gt;Lore wise, how come all Light casters/users are able to still wield Light when they are affected by the corruption of the Void?

&gt;Also why aren't shadow casters such as Shadow Priest and Warlock more influenced by the corruption and buffed, considering it's their domain? 


There is no **lore wise** reason. Blizzard has been categorically inconsistent with the lore surrounding light and void intermingling. Alleria and Turalyon not being able to touch was a cool throw-away plot thread that retconned the twilights, disc priest lore, the crucible, and a host of other things and will continue to confuse everyone as they soldier onward. For the second bit, shadow priests and warlocks likely do interact differently with the corruption permeating everything, but there aren't any central warlock or shadow priest characters at the moment. Anduin seems to be affected by it but as far as we can tell that might just be everybody and not specifically related to him being a priest. 

Of *course* from a gameplay perspective it would be a matter of developing peculiar interactions based on spec of class, but it's pretty clear for anyone who *reads his comment or grasps it at all* that when Avgvstvs starts off his comment with, ""how come all Light casters/users are able to still wield Light when they are affected by the corruption of the Void"" it's pretty obvious he isn't asking, ""how come blizz didn't disable the paladin class, one and a half specs of the priest, and the entire lightforged race while adding bonuses to shadow priests and warlocks?""  

Tip: if what you're about to argue against sounds absurd, maybe ask them to clarify. Turns out, not skipping over the first two words of his post would probably assist in making a response. 

On account of some trouble with reading comprehension, I'll break down how my original comment response to your post for you:

You wrote:

&gt;Some things simply get handwaved because they don’t fit in the lore

I wrote:

&gt;blizzard usually does the exact opposite

By which I mean, instead of introducing gameplay which contradicts lore and dismissing it (which is fine), they introduce lore that contradicts already existing lore AND gameplay, for seemingly no reason. And then just kind of go with it.

For example, *again*, Alleria and Turalyon not being able to touch. In an expansion that *just* introduced a host of disc priests with stories about intermingling light and shadow and Light's Wrath as their artifact. In a class hall where light and shadow ""twist about one another."" Several expansions after we did the whole ""light + shadow = twilight?!"" thing. 

You wrote: 

&gt;Blizzard can absolutely say “Turalyon and Alleria are a married couple who can’t even touch each other because they’re light and shadow, respectively” while also introducing a playable void elf class that can also be a holy priest AND wear void corrupted gear,

Yes that's fine, until-

&gt;..AND still be consistent. 

They have not. It isn't consistent. At all. Light's Wrath is inconsistent. Canon disc priest figures are inconsistent. The Twilights and Archbishop Benedictus are inconsistent. They could have avoided every inconsistency (*including* the gameplay ones, if you insist on bringing up gameplay at all) by leaving out that Turalyon and Alleria can't touch. 

Which is why I wrote,

&gt;Why not just leave the whole void and light thing interacting off the table? Leave it opened ended, make it a mystery, or simply say ""sure they work, it's called Twilight stuff and we have an entire flight of dragons and cult about it! Remember that Archbishop Benedictus and his whole light-and-shadow thing?""

Is this at all making more sense to you? The rest of your post with regards to Blizzard and the suspension of lore in lieu of gameplay I have no issue with - although you were arguing a point that didn't need to be argued. 

&gt;What would you have them do -

Not create new lore (which currently serves no purpose until probably a void expansion, who knows how far into the future) that contradicts old lore *and* more new lore that just occurred. 

&gt;allow void elves to be priests, but only shadow spec? Let LF draenei be priests, but only holy?

I wasn't implying that. /u/Avgvstvs wasn't implying that. Nobody was implying that. Nobody brought up gameplay until *you* did, and then proceeded to complain your tangent on gameplay wasn't being grasped while never understanding the post you were replying to in the first place. Magnificent. Truly.

Not really hard to twist. Here's perfectly compatible logic I came up with in 5 seconds:

- The sun is made of fire.
- An'she is the sun, and can channel the Light.
- Fire elementals with an affinity for An'she or that come from An'she give DID the Light.

Cite for me one piece of canonical lore that proves the above can't happen.

&gt;Dark Shaman gain their powers by binding and enslaving Elements, using the powers of Decay, and not cooperating or bargaining. This is how the Kor'kron Shaman retained their powers, and why Thrall was unable to commune with the Elements when he confronted Garrosh (they had been forced from the area).

And also why none of the player characters are Dark Shaman. So, your entire tangent about Dark Shaman is entirely irrelevant. 

&gt; instead uses some sort of facsimile based on the incorrect belief that they worship Fire Elementals.

Dude what? That's the core of their entire lore. The entire unlock scenario is about preventing over-zealous worshippers from bringing back Ragnaros. Fire elementals call Dark Irons ""child of fire"".",wow

Illidan did that. I already named Illidan as the exception.

Literally in the class description of Paladin.  ALL paladins are holy warriors that gain powers and blessings from the Light, and I'm talking Lore-wise and not just ingame mechanics.

* Draenei Paladins gained their power and connection to the Light by Naaru.
* Human Paladins started out as Clerics of the Holy Order of Northshire Clerics, aka Priests who trained in martial combat to better protect themselves.
* Dwarves were trained as Paladins by Humans.
* High Elves also believed in the Holy Light, and Paladins likely existed before exposure to the Human and Dwarven Order of the Silver Hand (High Elf Paladins still exist, serving the Silver Covenant)
* Blood Elf Paladins received their power by siphoning the Light energy of Mu'ru, an imprisoned Naaru (again, a being of Light).  Later, they draw their energy from the restored Sunwell, which is now infused with the Light.
* Tauren Paladins, aka Sunwalkers, receive their powers by drawing the Light energy from An'she, the sun.
* Zandalari Paladins, aka Prelates, draw their power from worship and belief in Rezan, the Holy Loa of Kings.  It is unknown what connection Rezan has with the Light, but it does exist.
* The few Night Elf Paladins receive their Light connection through Elune, who Velen believes may be a Naaru.

Trying to suggest that Dark Iron Paladins are not actual Paladins, but receive ""Light-like abilities"" from Fire Elementals is absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also, Shaman are different. Shaman get their powers by cooperating and bargaining with elementals. Paladins get their power through pure belief. The former is a relationship of peers. The latter is a relationship of subservience.

Dark Shaman gain their powers by binding and enslaving Elements, using the powers of Decay, and not cooperating or bargaining.  This is how the Kor'kron Shaman retained their powers, and why Thrall was unable to commune with the Elements when he confronted Garrosh (they had been forced from the area).

Furthermore, belief is not a ""relationship of subservience.""  Subservience is the ""willingness to obey others unquestionably.""  Tirion Fordring broke his vows and was exiled from the Order of the Silver Hand for saving Eitrigg's life.  He even retained his Light-given abilities even after Uther performed a ceremony to strip him of them, further proving that it is not a ""relationship of subservience.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If a Dark Iron Dwarf were to fervently worship a powerful fire elemental, who rewards the DID with searing powers thanks to his belief, that has far more similarities to a Paladin than a Shaman.

Dark Iron Dwarves never *worshipped* Fire elementals. The entire clan was enslaved by Ragnaros and his minions when Sorceror-Thane Thaurissan accidentally summoned Ragnaros during the War of the Three Hammers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think you're interpreting game mechanics into lore too rigidly.

And I think you're lacking a basic grasp of lore altogether, if you believe that out of every Paladin race in the game, Dark Irons are the only ones who do not use Light or Holy Magic (which is literally the only thing that makes a Paladin a Paladin), and instead uses some sort of facsimile based on the incorrect belief that they worship Fire Elementals.",wow

Like I might help guildies or whoever gear up, but if they refuse to watch a quick video and keep making the same mistakes, making it so I have to do 'everything by myself' for stuff only they can reap some rewards, you're damn sure I'll refuse to group up with them again.

If the **very slightly higher** difficulty of fighting Alleria in melee is a problem for you, that's an issue with your skill. To anyone of moderate skill, that difference will never make or break your success in that fight, especially since the workaround is a very simple LOS trick.

If anything, that means the gameplay is better for melee because there's actual strategy and dynamic factors in the fight.

I don't see you whining about how M+ discourages players from ever bringing more than 1 ranged DPS. The difference in Alleria's fight is a **miniscule** change in difficulty in content that makes up a fraction of your actual playtime.

That's certainly your call, but if you are someone who is not overly interested in BfA PvP, one requires many 10s of hours of terrible grinding, and the other one involves a couple hours of arenas and then random PvE activities that take less than half an hour a week...I would say CnS is orders of magnitudes more palatable.

Pretty much every Essence has been time-gated otherwise, so CnS is really no exception in that regard. 

Additionally, if you put as much time into grinding Arena rating as it takes to get BotE, you would probably be getting it in 2-3 weeks instead. But 4-5 weeks with basically no real effort is a pretty good deal by Rank 3 essence standards.

I commented in the MELTDOWN thread about it, but what blizzard does here sets a precedent because of how this new mechanic works.

If they patch and hotfix the current abysmal imbalance that certain corruption traits in the maintenance tomorrow, it will provide the least fallout. Sure, some people have already acquired Heroic gear and PVP rating easier, but this now falls more in line with the general player approach of, ""Do the thing before it's patched/Exploit early exploit often"", the latter I don't condone, but has been evidenced in the past that players will do it. Especially when an exploit would give you a punishment in a ban less than the time it would take to achieve the exploited goal.

Should corruption *not* be addressed at all and remains the same going into mythic tomorrow, this might signal to us that Corruption is working as Blizzard now intends, despite nerfs already applied to certain overpowered traits beforehand. It'll become a Legion Legendary situation without the later patch catch-up of purchasing them--people will take people that have the gear that benefits them most, especially in DPS checks, *because* of the gear giving someone a 9k DPS edge over someone of equal skill alone, ESPECIALLY when the item is a 410 world quest ring. That shouldn't fucking happen.

And finally, the most heinous path Blizzard can take, is to hotfix it or patch it *after* mythic goes live. Should a high end guild like Method or Limit kill a boss such as Maut, which has a DPS check, and *then* corruption is *fixed* to a point that goal is no longer as achievable, heads are going to roll. Hell, if even Wrathion goes down with someone in those top DPS slots pulling amazing damage because of an outlandishly OP corruption trait, that precedent is set, and you'd be, to some people, favoring that first guild because they beat the boss before *they* were nerfed, rather than the other way around.

But at this point I'm beginning to ramble. There are some other solutions I'm sure but corruption was not tested and handled well enough for live. It's an interesting system on paper, and I enjoy aspects of it, but live? It's not as smooth as I'd like for the whole of the game.",wow

Blizzard can absolutely say “Turalyon and Alleria are a married couple who can’t even touch each other because they’re light and shadow, respectively” while also introducing a playable void elf class that can *also* be a holy priest AND wear void corrupted gear, AND still be consistent. 

[Gameplay and Story Segregation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration?from=Main.GameplayAndStoryIntegration) is a common trope in many other games, and WoW makes EXTENSIVE use of it, in *many* other ways. Certainly there’s a right way and a wrong way to go about it, but I think generally Blizzard’s got a good track record about this sort of thing, with regards to race/class combos.

Not sure why they established this, because the patch after they introduced these characters and decided to add ""void"" to one and ""lightforged"" to the other, they added void elf holy priests and lightforged shadow priests. In an expansion that established disc priests as priests who combine shadow and light magic.

What I believe they are adding is different skins to different races, most people seem to hate the allied races rep lock and with Shadowlands adding more customization and the allied races are done so quick they really don't get that much customization at all. It wouldn't be sustainable in Shadowlands and they're  was also no revealed allied races at all at Blizzcon.

Doing this also makes sense since their adding an entirely new zone for new leveling characters in Stormheim. Because why would you be playing a Sandfury or Wildhammer (There were revealed skins and tattoos at Blizzcon.) and you're doing the Darkspear quest line or Ironforge Dwarf questline, it doesn't make sense at all from a lore standpoint, so they made an entirely new zone for new characters.",wow
