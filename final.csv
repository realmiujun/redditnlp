"The group that I (music) and one of my colleagues (PE) run were previously done as independent ‚Äúwork‚Äù stations. So obviously, most of that time was being wasted by the kiddos. So we plugged in the specialists (art, music, PE, and library) into these groups so that the kids have NO time without an adult.

Part of the reason that‚Äôs possible is the size of our school and the set up of our schedule. But the difference was the adults, basically.",happy
My kids go to a University model school. They go to school three days a weeks and home schooled two days. I love being hands on with their education but it is seriously HARD. So thank you for what you do. It matters and you are making a difference. Those kids are lucky to have you.,happy

"I had a similar experience as an SAT tutor recently. The group that is close to graduation and is taking the SATs has done extremely well on the Writing &amp; Language and Reading sections and especially the essay. They all came to me to give me a card and explain how much I helped them around Christmas. 

The main thing that I do for the students is to correct at least one practice SAT essay in Microsoft Word with the comments. Some of my comments are longwinded. Some are copy/pasted and short for repeated mistakes (e.g., ‚ÄúAvoid contractions as they are considered informal speech‚Äù), but I point out every tiny mistake, including poor penmanship. I always explain that this approach is meant to point out areas of improvement as opposed to personally attacking them. By doing this, I hope to individually target areas of improvement for each student and expose them to a certain learning ethic that requires that a student sets aside personal feeling and pay attention to areas of improvement. 

I learned later from one of their parents that the 4 of them got together and went all over all of my notes the day before the SAT. 

As far as the card goes, my wife, who tends to just throw things away, must have thrown away the card. I found it in the trash and fished it out. The card is surprisingly not harmed and is hidden away.",happy
"Wow! You've literally improved the future of so many children. What an incredible accomplishment, well done.",happy

How did you get them to improve so much? I ask because my gf is a 4th grade teacher and her kids are SUPER low. I'd love to be able to give her some added tips to what she's already doing.",happy
"That initial curtsey. 

Dang. 

Also how fancy a school!",happy

Thanks for all the kind comments guys :) We flew back home and got married this past October in his backyard (where we first met). It's crazy to look at that place and remember setting off fireworks, chasing each other with water guns, and now it's where our marriage began.

UPDATE: my husband knows this is here now o\_o and so do his colleagues at work (since it made the front page) also, so many of you are totally right, I shouldn't just delete this because of the negativity. And now that he knows it's here anyways, it doesn't matter.",happy

My husband and I just separated. It's adjustment. I have a 1 year old and a 5 year old. I did mostly everything on my own in the marriage anyway, but the most trying is getting them to sleep.

"Indeed. FCA didn‚Äôt see it that way as it tends to live in the upper rev range. When I tuned my c7 z06 I noticed a steep decline, but that‚Äôs because my right foot is always at the floor.

My e30 318i gained almost 40 miles to the tank and it‚Äôs a tad peppier.

"Never heard that.  You can actually see they don't if you look at say a cop suv.  Ever wonder why the ride so low, the weight.

Police cars are also said for their mileage to be equal to a car with 1.5 times the mileage.  Mostly because police cars sit and idle so much.  Either way with that little miles and a couple maintenance items since it is at 60k it should be a reliable car.",happy

I actually found hidden in my dyslexia was a strength I never knew. Later, I found Malcom Gladwells ""David and Golith"" which is about the strengths in weaknesses. There is a whole story about the greatness of Dyslexia in it that was truly eye-opening. 

Way to go!",happy

The recording was made in a small chapel in my hometown which has a Mixtuur virtual organ with 1903 Notre Dame de Metz Cavaill√©-Coll sample set. I would definitely love to try out the real one in Metz someday but I guess that's gonna be just a beautiful dream.

I chose the registrations myself. However, when I was in the training mode I listened the masterpiece literally hundreds and hundreds of times played by different professionals such as Olivier Latry, Helmut Walcha and Karl Richter. Therefore I think it is safe to say that their versions strongly influenced my choices.

I really hope you'll master it someday too!",happy

Hang in there, I‚Äôm always here to chat or just be an internet stranger from afar cheering you on. I know life won‚Äôt suddenly be all sunshine and rainbows for me now, but it‚Äôs important to remember how far we have come and where we have been to get where we are now.

"Thank you so much! I did intermittent fasting, with a daily calorie allowance of 1200. When I‚Äôd go to the gym I‚Äôd up my calories to about 1400 and up my protein. I didn‚Äôt so much change *what* I ate, still had my little sweet treats and pastas and such haha, it‚Äôs just all about portion control and watching your calories. My typical fasting windows are between 18:6-22:2, but if you‚Äôre just starting out the standard is 16:8, which for most would be: 12pm-8pm you can eat, and outside of that, you fast. Basically like skipping breakfast, having a good lunch and dinner, and not eating a few hours before bed (you can move around your windows to your personal preference). I highly recommend the /intermittentfasting sub, it really helped me through the journey. Of course, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, so 1200 worked for me because my BMR was around 1550. So essentially, just eating fewer calories than what your body needs to maintain your current weight was a big factor. I recommend finding out your BMR (tons of online calculators!) then eating, say, 200 calories below that if you‚Äôre trying to lose weight. But play around with it! It‚Äôs different for everyone. Best of luck friend :)",happy
Good for you and way to take control! I made the same decision a few years ago and don't regret it one bit. Surround yourself with people who make you feel good. It's good to be picky in this regard.,happy

"People have a habbit of not saying what the really mean and just proving dishonestly, people tell me things then lie about me, im just trying to find a crowd because the last few years have been really rough, with depression, rehab, the accidents, my body and my mind have been through a lot, im trying to just stand on my feet and keep walking, but I've been walking bymyself for the last few years and it's just become unbearable, this might sound like just something that any 16 year old would say but its true, im getting tired of all the times people use me as a baseline for what they want to surround themselves with, then when they find out that I'm my own unique person, then im the bad guy for just being myself, its been a constant struggle for me to even find someone to talk to, being told I'm not good enough for then just for them to complain to me asking me why no one can be like me, its childish, just stop placing my on the god damn shelf and I could be a life long ally, but nooooo, im apperently not good enough at being me to be myself, why cant people just like me for me rather than trying to find someone else better than me, I dont have a bad opinion of myself nor do i hate myself anymore, but these constant situations where people tell me I'm bot good enough, replace me, then they come back to me looking for compassion is taking its effect on my self worth, i dont have time to be worrying about a social life, but damn, how I'm crying on the inside all the time because I want a connection to someone that is authentic and not just fill their needs kind of thing, I put myself first these days because I have my career in IT to focus on, if being a child means being like them, then make me as old as you want because I refuse to act like them

Sorry for the rant, I kinda figure thats what this reddit is for",angry
"Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know how to organize this. I guess I‚Äôll start with the events leading up to my realization. So I‚Äôm in a high school music group of ~18 people. We compete in a national championship for music every year, and often make it pretty far - to where we‚Äôll be traveling.

So we spent the night in a hotel one state over. We take two large vans to this competition, and split into two groups of nine. Its very clear that it‚Äôs split into the ‚Äúcooler‚Äù kids and the ‚Äúnot as popular‚Äù squads. I‚Äôm in the not so popular group, which I‚Äôm fine with because they‚Äôre some of my closest friends. 

Anyway, we spent most of our trip in these two groups.
1) every time we went out to eat at a big table, the table would be nearly perfectly split in two by group
2) we decided to go swimming. Except.., only the non popular group ended up going because the popular group somehow decided it was boring.
3) the two vans were both gonna stop to get something to eat Tonight on our way home; team bonding and all that. But the OTHER van decided they‚Äôd rather just go home. So then MY van decides to go home... 

You can see where this is going. Am I being childish, or imagining this??

I‚Äôm close to tears typing this because I‚Äôm just SO damn angry. This is the ONE thing in my life that was never supposed to be cliquey. EVERY OTHER THING IN HIGH SCHOOL IS. 

And it all started because our director let in two people that a few of us already hated. And we try to be nice to them. We still try to be a family. But it‚Äôs shit like this that makes me so disheartened, to the point I almost want to quit. We got second place, now going on to national semifinals. I should be over the moon right now. 

But instead I‚Äôm crying out of frustration. Cool. 

I try to focus on my little group and how much I love them, but even they have their issues. Two of my best friends are now dating and focus on each other more than our friendship. My other close friends are just... drifting away and frustrate me soooo often that I question if it‚Äôs worth it. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, or how to navigate even my own feelings on the topic. Thanks for reading, if anyone cares... :/",angry

"I know since the cause wasn't determined, there probably was nothing we could do to prevent this. It's been at least 5 years since my grandpa was diagnosed, and it's just so frustrating. My grandparents took my siblings and I in when we were younger because my parents weren't able to properly take care of us. They're basically my parents. I'm turning 17 soon, and watching this disease progress every single day is torture. 
We refuse to put him in a nursing home. My grandma was a nurse, she knows how the people treat the patients there. I was a teen pregnancy, so my grandparents are very young. I can't help but feel I took him for granted. He's only 59 years old and he can't even go to the bathroom anymore. A 59 year old man in adult diapers. This disease does so much more than just make someone forgetful. He is starting to have trouble eating by himself, so we have to watch him to see if he needs help. It's so hard seeing the person who took you in as his own go through such a horrible thing. His mother had Alzheimer's and his father had Dementia, I can't imagine how he felt when he got diagnosed. He knew what would happen. 
I have been talking to him at least twice every day, saying the exact same 5 phrases. He recognizes my face now, but I've noticed the replies he used to give are becoming less frequent, and are now mostly gibberish. I always try to pretend I understand what he's saying, he seems to like that a lot. But watching everything slow down like this is brutal.
The worst thing is that sometimes he just randomly breaks down crying. It takes a little bit to calm him down, but it just shows all of the pain he's really in. Every day is a constant state of confusion, and when he's not confused, he is having very intense emotions, that come out of nowhere. Not all parts of the brain deteriorate. 
It's only going to get worse, and there's not a sliver of hope for him. He has been robbed of all of the experiences he dreamed of. There's been so many new grandkids, marriages, and soon graduations that he's missed. Sometimes I wonder if he's better off dead. I don't wish death on him at all, but he's so far gone already. I just want his pain to stop.

Sorry that was a mess, I've been frazzled lately.",angry
"Today, I went to the mini-mart near my house with a friend. We‚Äôve both lived in the area for about 5 years, and are no strangers to the spot. I typically go in for my nicotine fix and a soda, and today was no different. When I got up to the counter to pay, the cashier said, ‚Äúmy manager wants to speak to you two about stealing‚Äù. My friend and both gave each other a confused look then laughed it off, chalking it up as a joke. She continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. He installed a security camera a couple days back‚Äù.  I said that I‚Äôve never stolen anything from a store (completely true statement) and I‚Äôve been going to this same mini mart for 5 years, getting the same thing almost every time. My friend was very agitated and called her out saying that‚Äôs blatantly not true , but she wouldn‚Äôt drop it. I asked her to call her manager so I can speak with him (I know him from being in there so often) and she refused me saying I needed to come in on Monday to speak to him. She did this in front of a large group of people and it really fired me up. I think this might be a sign to quit buying nicotine, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about that exchange. Should I go in to clear myself of any bullshit they‚Äôve accused me or my friend of, or should I just plan on never going back in?",angry
"Brought in a good friend of my wife‚Äôs into our home.

All was great and then she started breaking our trust with so much random bullshit, but we thought well she‚Äôs just trying to figure herself out again, after being in a really abusive relationship. 

We give, give and give and we get fucking shit on constantly, couple months of this and we have a sit down, things get slightly better.... but no progress is made to better her living situation with her daughter... then we go on vacation me and my wife have been waiting for and planned for over 9months. 

We jokingly say to eachother ‚Äúwonder how long till douchebag ( her boy toy ) shows up at the house‚Äù and like clockwork within 3-4 days he‚Äôs over at night, a guy we‚Äôve never met, complete stranger to us, and she brings him in to our home, no asking, no consideration for our rules ( she knows we dislike him a lot ) ... tell her she needs to pack her shit and be gone by the time we get back.

Fast forward to yesterday( Friday ) she calls us in a panic and the place she found to live, well it‚Äôs a real no go now.... so we say ok.... when we get home we‚Äôll sit down and talk. 

Wife has been having issues with the whole thing on a stress and emotional level and that sent her over the edge, so she told her to just get out for the night as we arrive to our home after 20+ hours of traveling...

Come to find out, our beloved cat is fucking missing... gone. No trace. Walked the neighborhood, talked to a couple neighbors I have as friends. Nada. She says she saw him before she left today... but someone left the black door open for over 5 minutes , and he‚Äôs always been an indoor cat but will escape and panic and usually come in....

I feel fucking devastated, I struggle enough with my emotional state, trying to keep myself together from a decade of bottling up my emotions and being numb... I will never trust anyone ever again. People genuinely fucking suck. I can‚Äôt sleep because I can‚Äôt even start to process what I feel and how I should react. I just want my cat back.... 

Oh, and she also broke a phone I lent her, again, only found out because it was sitting on the counter and doesn‚Äôt turn on....",angry

I work full time just like him but do so much more unpaid work at home, this is not fucking fair. I told him all of this numerous times which leads to the promise that he will do it this weekend, and yet here I am again I'm crying on the couch right fucking next to him and he doesn't even notice...",angry

SO MUCH FUCKING HATE. 

My regrets give me psychotic episodes no one knows about, and now I'm living with anxiety about these episodes...I dont want to be put away but it makes my heart hurt, how I go from laughing to crying to a feral anger..its so hard in public to keep my composure, whenever I'm outside I feel dead inside and its sucking the life out of my hobbies, and I have insomnia so I have a lot of time to think things over...but I'm so tired...I'm so fed up",angry

"I now consider myself as homophobic and want the T remove from LGB they always says the rapists who going into to women's bathrooms are ""trans"" in reality it's either creepy guys or homosexual men trying to sabotage trans women. They think it's trans people actual dysphoric trans people for the creation of transtrenders well gays and lesbians you are the ones who promoted trans stereotypes that made these monsters that are non human also like non binary, gender non conforming, genderfluid and all the rest of the made up bullshit 100 genders. Then people who supports these fools are feminists and meninist they are trying to take over by using trans people against each other. They are the same thing people who want money and power hungry by using gender non conforming gender that doesn't exist you are either look like a boy/man or girl/woman in the view of society I do believe biological sex is important to bring up especially getting into a relationship I agree with that. No wonder homosexuals were illegal for such a long time and being hated in almost every religion they do shit like what's happening now taking away our culture and socialization. Homosexuality is a sin and I'm fully against it now since how they treated me hell they can't produce to spread their blood, flesh and genetic as a trans woman I like women because I generally get along better with women (females mainly) and I can reproduce and spread my blood and last name. I consider myself as a transgender/transexual separtist we true dysphoric trans people had enough with all of the stereotypes we will declare war on all lesbians and gays. Let them get slaughted in the middle east they would do the same there and support are true dysphoric trans brothers and sisters.

"I‚Äôm sick and tire of it all. Since the start of my high school my grades have gradually dropped from hero to zero. 10th grade was alright, but last year was so bad that I thought I would‚Äôve failed it. Now in my senior year the pattern seems to repeat itself, and I‚Äôve been trying my hardest to improve my grades. Thankfully, my school offers some chances to retake an exam should you get a low grade. I‚Äôve studied and even asked a teacher to tutor me in math and physics (he tells me that I can easily grasp their subjects and enjoys teaching me, which I‚Äôm grateful for) but then in the actual damn tests I always seem to forget one stupid thing or panic at a question (keep in mind that the questions relate to each other) and end up wasting time or making stupid mistakes. I just lost 33% because I forgot how to find an inverse function and I panicked in my physics test. All of this studying and tutoring and I end up losing a bunch of grades to a single meaningless formula, and then I wonder what the fuck is the point of studying? And the after all of this bullshit the school expects us to study for the midterms next week over this weekend. I hate myself, I hate my school and fuck education and my shithole of a country‚Äôs shitty and old education system.

Not only that, but working on schoolwork at home [has been SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN to have negative effects on students](https://news.stanford.edu/2014/03/10/too-much-homework-031014/). Why do we still continue to hand it out?",angry

I know it must be hard living your sad day to day life living out of a hotel that your brother has to pay for because you‚Äôve gotten evicted from yet another flea infested hovel with your aggressive dogs and usually AT LEAST one of your adult children who also look to my sisters fianc√© (and I know it reeeaally gets your goat that he gave her that biiiig shiny ring when you can‚Äôt even get a guy to commit to a second date after he sees your unfiltered face, sober, and in the daylight) to bail them out both financially and legally.

I am so unbelievably angry at you. Who leaves a five month old kitten behind in the dead of winter? Who the **** does that shit? 

You. I brought her in for a chip check. The vet found nothing. They even gave her a quick one over and agreed she was too friendly to be a feral, too well groomed and was a whopping 5 pounds. She needs to fatten up a bit. I am so angry. How dare you. 

As of today, I now have four cats. We are naming her Nova and she won‚Äôt have to go crawling into someone‚Äôs mudroom in a storm crying. She sleeps on our bed, curls up on the couch and two of the others in our home make sure she eats and clean her and play with her.  

You abandoned a kitten. Monsters do that. God I hope you don‚Äôt ever get another cat. You don‚Äôt deserve your dogs. 

This little baby is ours now. Some day my anger will dissipate. But for now it has a pretty good hold on me. Enjoy your life, I will get revenge by giving her a far better home.",angry
"
First off to the guy who influenced my now former best friend to dump me. You are a manipulative asshole, to some people you might be a nice guy but youre a type of asshole who grab on to a girl date her and have her cut off ppl that cares about her so when you guys fight you can throw it in her face that she will have no one else to help or support her emotionally. You say that you dont see me as a threat you say you respect me but you are so full of shit especially when you said you dont want to get between a friendship if so you can tell her we could still be friends just no more me doing stuff for her you overly jealous fuck! Ever since you dated her you end up getting sick (which affected your physical health now you got a fucked up knee) and lost your job ( good luck with that health insurance for the physical therapy). As cruel as it might sound but I relish that fact it happen to you, you truly deserve that because it goes to show that the universe is truly punishing you for who you are. You are nothing more but now a 32yr old unemployed guy (cant say man cuz you arent one) who tries to be a rapper who twitch streams and sells weed living out of your moms basement. Your talent is nothing but laughable since no one heard your ‚Äútracks‚Äù when youre at the ‚Äústudio‚Äù and your twitch streams are generic as hell with no entertainment value. I hope this year gives you more strife and pain for taking away my best friend. And also a shitty boyfriend ive seen your last relationship you almost harmed your ex the fighting and everything a leopard cant change its spot you dickhead( As harsh it might sound the anger i possess for him has been true) 

Now on to my former best friend we were fine up until you started dated him. You let the idea of someone new in a relationship fill your head with ideas and you treated me so much more differently. Took extremes to block me when it isnt necessary. I gave you every thing for the sake of our friendship and to make you happy when you had nothing. But alas youre a sheep in this and youre equally to blame. You made it sound so easy to drop me out of 7 yrs of friendship all the times we hung out took you to amazing and fantastic places only for you to drop me just like that. I resent it, as much as i love you and youre still in my heart, i hate the person you became. Hope the universe will correct that take away everything your new job your money. The fact that you might need to support your ‚Äúrapper‚Äù boyfriend is truly laughable. Hope this year also gives you the strife at the end of the day whatever pain or emotional break down you might have im no longer there to help you pick you up like i always have and your family is definitely very little help and so will he. I honestly hope your relationship burns to the ground i have so many ppl both mutual friends and my friends say you two wont last long and im betting on it. What truly boggles me is REALLY? THIS DOUCHEBAG? You really enjoy sleeping over with him for the weed that youre paying for!  you‚Äôre paying him for the weed! Seriously what a shit boyfriend. And honestly hes nothing but room and board when you dont want to be at home lets be honest with yourself, I know he said to be on your own two feet, another reason why you decide to drop me as a friend, but youre that dumb that you cant see through the manipulation that he cant do the things i have done for you! Its fucking sad and you have the nerve to demand shit from me after the fact again hate the person you became hopefully this year will show you what a mistake you made cutting off someone who genuinely cares about you friendzoned or not my heart has always cared about being there and helping when you need it and when youre back to having nothing again",angry
It's literally this stopping me from dating this girl who I think is absolutely perfect. Now she thinks I only want to fuck her. Not the case. Sure that's a part of it but not all of it.

I'll beat up the (most likely) females that have spread this bullshit. I dont fucking care anymore.,angry

I'm not saying you aren't, but when you go into every movie, show, and album knowing full well you're going to critique every nook and cranny like Sherlock Holmes on a coke bender you've moved beyond being just a consumer and into a realm where every pile of kindling somehow needs to be sparked and ignited and stoked into a full blown forest fire.

It seems like a lot of people enjoy shitting on things more than they do just enjoying them. It's honestly exhausting seeing it everywhere in every facet of media. 

It's even more annoying when the best place to talk about something you like is obviously the most populated subreddit/forum/group, but these anti-fans feel the need to constantly chime in and tell you why you're wrong for liking that scene/arc/beat because it did/didn't follow this formula, it was written and produced by troglodytes, and how it was all just fan service and nothing in media should EVER try to please the people who actually like it because they dont know what it is they REALLY want and art for art's sake should come before all else and fuck you for sitting back and taking it like the simple minded fuckboi you are.",angry

Today I was informed by my boss that he has given the vacancy in my team to someone who has ZERO applied experience.

He's a journalist who has done a bit of data analysis and they have given him the job! 

It took me years (and a data-focused masters) to be hired and this guy strolls in with his privilege and gets it. I am fuming! 

I want a new job. Tired of working in a thankless role that apparently any arse can walk into. I am just going to keep my head down and get on with my job until something new comes along. 

And this guy can fuck RIGHT off if he thinks I am training him in anything.

It‚Äôs hard to have sympathy for people like me. I live a very privilege life. But still. Just had a wonderful ski trip in Zermatt. Made these beautiful go pro videos for my 92 yo grandma. On the way back me my mom and brother wanted to see the Ch√¢teau Chillon and parked on the side of the road along with a lot of other people. Someone broke the window and took just my backpack with my macbook go pro beats headphones AirPods and stuff coming to probably 2.5k. But mostly they stole all my videos. And I lost it in-front of my mom and brother. This was a vacation I paid for completely because there was no way they could have. I called my girlfriend and her first reaction was why did you have all that stuff in your backpack. My insurance is I‚Äôll pay for the car. I got travel insurance that will cover at least my computer so after a lot hassle I‚Äôll prob be only out at grand. But still like fuck last I was mugged in Paris. Like wtf am I doing wrong.,angry

"I want to make this clear....even reddit CAN be considered social media, but it is social media with a purpose! The entire concept is to gather like-minded people to discuss and share various things about various topics. It is therefore excluded from this rant.

My target is social media that is nothing more than boasting a ""perfect"" version of your life. Ever since its inception it has plagued our fucking society with notions of favoratism and ideals. Like a drug, it gives us a rush as we get likes for proving that we are living lives worth living. That feeling soon wears off as we cling to our news feeds and get FOMO. This feeling is based out of fear that, because John was busy going to the fucking Grand Canyon, he doesn't give a shit about my BBQ that I had this weekend. Friendships and relationships are actually broken because of a lack of feeding our dopamine rush of likes, photos and whatever the fuck else.

It has spawned a culture of influencers who LITERALLY CAPITALIZE OFF OF THIS! Of course, it all ties into the advertizing industry(sweet baby Jesus don't even get me started) and these people amass MILLIONS of dollars and followers. They are ACTUALLY CALLED INFLUENCERS and they can basically get their following to do WHATEVER if they say it. It truly is fascinating AND scary at the same time. 

I say this as someone who had succesfully deleted social media out of their life for..I think 5 years now? I moved accross the country and I decided it would be nice to have a way to keep in touch with family back home and to show them how I am doing. I have been on it for less than a day and my fucking headache has returned. I would be less pissed off about it if I felt like I could just have NO social media and just live my fucking life. But no, it is seen as off-putting and creepy if you don't have some sort of internet profile where I post all of my useless shit while simultaneously having all of my movements and imteractions tracked and thrown into algorithms so the internet can also try and sell me shit that they THINK I would like.

Go ahead. Try it for yourself. Start talking about some useless(but reasonable) item that you would NEVER need or want. Within a week you will start getting adverts for it.


As someone who studies computer science, technology is amazing and has brought us so far. Now get off of Facebook. Stop trying to prove to the world that you have an amazing life and just GO AND HAVE AN AMAZING LIFE. Or at least don't look down on me for doing it.

"A little background:
My boyfriend's parents died when he was younger so then he and his brother had to live with his aunt and uncle. Ever since I started dating him I've learned that they treat him like a slave. He's run away multiple times in the past because of their treatment.   His aunt and cousins don't like me and I don't like them either. My bf is almost 18 but not yet so since his parents are dead he's supposed to be living with his aunt till he can get on his own feet as a legal adult. He wants to join the police or military and is apart of some internships to earn a bit of money.

Now to the story.

So I just heard from my bf that he wasn't living with his aunt anymore. Now you may think, ""oh he just moved out."" Nope. He said she kept his phone, that he bought himself, and the laptop he needed for school and some other things of his. He was currently messaging me from his friends phone. He said he has bags of his stuff but he is at school. I agreed to meet him today afterschool and I am gonna give him one of my phones so he can communicate or at least in case he needs to call the police in case of emergency. He said he slept outside my house this morning but I must have not been up. I immediately saw this is the last strike of patience I had with his aunt. When I meet with him I plan to go to his aunt's house and ask for his things but if she doesn't get them back I will either call the police or punch her and force my way in the house and get his stuff myself.

I'll update when I see my bf to tell you what I do.

Anyway, after a few minutes of me nearly getting him calm and my grandpop snapping at him again, I said 'I'm out', picked him up, and calmly walked out. Everyone was on my side. I got multiple calls from relatives telling me I did the right thing.

The problem: I hated myself for it. I wish I'd told him to fuck off and gotten into an argument and stayed there eating lunch with everyone glaring at me. Being the calm one is awful.

"

Pretty much a tale as old as time i guess you lose your best friend to the person they're dating. There is something to be said about you honestly some say you might be a good guy, some say a major douche with control and jealousy issues. During that whole time i never had an issue with you until recently. I had a really great friend we use to talk everyday made promises with each other i helped support her emotionally and financially when times were tough on her. Made her smile everyday and wouldve given the world to her. Truthfully i was in love with her but she never had that interest and truthfully i made my peace with that because having her in my life having her to have my back when times were tough was a blessing in life. We had promises to each other to never give up on each other and to never abandon each other and i was her only best friend who never took advantage of the friendship given like many had to her. 

But you came into the picture somehow possibly making promises and influence her to cut me out of her life yet got the nerve to tell it to my face that you dont want to get in between a friendship you were so full of it. Then and there i wanted to put you in the ground and beat you senseless. You told her to cut me out not because you want her to be on her own two feet because truthfully you have a problem of me being her only best friend who was a guy who honestly wants nothing more to make her happy something you're ego cant handle. Many so many of our mutual friends have told me you guys wont last and i really hope you guys dont because one day she will realize what you have done, you overly jealous maniacal controlling douche. You couldve been smart you couldve let us be friends just holding back on the support but no you convinced her to block and drop me after 7 yrs of friendship you are the worse type of person among many who deserves to die alone. 

Maybe my words are harsh, maybe just maybe they aren't warranted but i do curse you for taking away someone i care about. Hope the universe finds a way to give you what you deserve but i had to get this off my chest even if the blame should be on her as well to decide to listen to you but your influence did this i know her too well to know shes a follower in a new relationship and one day she will be sick of your control and will want freedom and will blame you that she lost her only best friend. You wont ever change nor have a future so keep dreaming of being an aspiring rapper ""dropping tracks"" in the ""studio"" and selling weed out of your moms basement. Ppl tell me to let it go wish them the best i truly cannot you had someone betray and abandon me you do not deserve an ounce of happiness at all! Hope god or whatever higher power punish you for taking away someone they care about i hope she will realize soon how cut off she is from everyone how uncomfortable she will be with your friends who she cannot be around with hope you show the ugly ugly side of you you piece of garbage.",angry

"I've been constantly watching over her (my dog) for 4 days and you may think is not a big deal but when I say watching over her I mean it literally all the time. 

Like every thing I would do in the day I would have her at my side, like even when I took a bath I'd put his bed in the bathroom so I can watch her every now and then.

All of this because she has a wound in his leg that has to be exposed so it heals faster but at the same time he can't lick it or it'll get worse (that's why I was constantly watching what she was doing), so with the help of some pills and a special spray she was almost healed. 

I was so proud of it and relieved because it looked real bad at first.

So my mom comes home, I ask her if he can walk the dog, she says sure in a while, and I also asked her if she could watch over her and she said sure.

I explicitly told her that if she's sure and that she has to really pay attention to what she was doing and she said that yea no problem.

Well fuck that, after I was ready to go to bed I head to the living room where she was to take my dog (because we sleep together) and surprise surprise, the fucking wound looks even fucking worse than before.

What's more I even asked her how is she and she says oh she's just fine and just as she was saying that my dog was licking his wound over and over.

So yea, all my hard work and everything that I did was for nothing. I felt pretty fucking angry so I just didn't say anything, cleaned the wide open wound again, apply the spray, gave her her pill and then I headed back to my room.

I was still very angry and I think I haven't felt that angry in forever, so I texted my mum a lot of ugly things and asked her not in a very polite way to fucking take the dog to the vet again because she is an useless piece of shit that can't look after her not even for a couple of hours because I have to fucking study for my finales god fucking damn it the incompetence of some people is out of this world holy shit I just wanna smash everything in my room.",angry

"I don't understand why apparently no one likes my company. No one likes to hang out with me. Not one of my friends that I have from work ever ask me to hang out with them. They don't invite me to parties, trips, events, or anything fun. The only thing I get invited to is to go out to eat during our lunch break, or drink at the end of my night shifts. I find mindless eating very boring and I don't like to do that as that can lead to gaining a lot of unnecessary weight. None of my ""friends"" ever respond to my texts when I ask them if they would like to hang out or do something with my child. Yet, I always see them on Facebook conversing with our other friends and I am left out. Nobody, including my coworkers and family ask me about my life, as they're only interested in my 4 year old daughter. Please note that I love my daughter very much as she is my world, but I'm the only one that reminds myself that I matter too. I must take care of myself also to be the best mother I can be to her, or else I can burnout, which is detrimental to her well-being. I feel like maybe something is off with me. No one wants to hear about my life or my hobbies, yet I see tons of other people especially on Facebook that have friends that give them support. I've done everything from putting myself out there more, initiating social gatherings, and posting my opinions and thoughts more on social media only for them to all be ignored. I only get likes if my posts or pics involve my child. No one likes me. I'm all alone with my daughter right now on new years eve. Nobody has invited us anywhere. My boyfriend has never spent one holiday with my child and I. His excuse is that he doesn't like holidays and loves to work on holidays to make that extra money ( we work in the restaurant industry as servers). I wish I had some adults to hang out with. I'm tired of not being able to socialize. People only want me when I'm doing something useful for my life, or if people need me to do them a favor, and its usually something they can do by themselves, or something I definently cannot do.

"I dont want to go into too much detail. I've been in pain for over 2 years, I was kicked out of a program even though I was an A student and had 0 discipline actions.

Instead of trying to mediate, the teacher immediately defends her (shes more popular than me) and continually tries to get the school to kick me out. 

Well they finally do, despite 0 incident report, they kick me out because I ""have communication issues."" Big fucking suprise. They dont call autism a communication disorder for no reason, do they?

"At the beginning of our relationship, we went out a lot. Had fun experiences. Now all we do is watch fucking anime and Netflix. You play videogames, I sit on my phone. I stopped trying to get you to do anything because 90% of the time when I suggested something, you would say no and that you just didn't feel like it. But you never put much effort into figuring something out. It was always my de facto responsibility because you never want to do anything. Because it costs money, or you're tired, or you have work at 10/11AM. Not early. And then a few weeks ago. You said we never go out. I'm not over it. Who's fucking fault is that? I'm not going to keep asking you to go out if you won't put in a modicum of effort to reach a compromise. I've wanted to go to shows, gallery openings, on walks outdoors, movies. But those cost money? Well so does the shitty alcohol and dishes that we bring to house parties hosted by your friends where all we do is play beer pong and those dumb ass TV games, not to mention the gas it takes to get there and back because they live 30+ minutes away. All we did was add more people to the experience of drinking or staring at a screen, when that money could have been spent on an actually enriching experience, or supporting local artists. I'm sick of it. 

The other thing you do is, every time I bring up a valid criticism or point about your behaviour, if I've done something remotely similar, no matter how long ago, you throw it back in my face. And when I ask you when it was or what I said, you don't know. Because it doesn't actually matter. All that matters is that I did it so it means when you do it's fine or normal or whatever, even if I've apologized or changed my behaviour. So it's impossible to reach a resolution. We just go in circles. You play fucking Pokemon while I'm talking to you. While we're talking about something pretty serious. 

I asked you twice and told you once to leave, but because ""it's comfortable here"", you get to stay. Go the fuck home. The only reason it's comfortable is because I put in effort to make it better, and to keep it clean. I'm done.",angry

"I think that Stupendium (Internet Singer and song maker who rocks) stole music from blAke (Internet singer and also a gamer), as Stupendium's song (ARt of Darkness) has the exact same notes as blAke's song (In this case that's MISBEHAVE), which is no good.

"I'm hurt. I dont know who I can tell because I'm embarrassed. I'm lucky enough that I can go to a hotel and stay the night, but I wish I had a friend around here instead I could stay with. My husband hates my family (he has a right, but that's another story). I do my best to ""protect him"" around them, although they actually try to make sure he feels welcome and he gives none back at this point. Long story short, it puts him on edge. We had my family's christmas out of town, rushed back 2 hours, and made it, with an hour to spare, to his sister's husband's (our BIL's) birthday at a restuarant. After the restaurant we went to a bar to hang out for a bit. (I've been in a great mood the whole day). About 12:30am we make it home. He yells at me for only taking 1 trip instead of 2. I'm pissed bc who gives a fuck. He goes back out for a 2nd trip bringing in 2 red bulls. I give him shit for going out of his way to make me feel like crap, and he tries to yell at me. He shoves me down, twice, (never gotten physically violent before), and goes to bed. I take my bag (that was still packed from my family christmas) and go to a hotel. I'm here now, but hurting. I don't know who to text, because I'm embarrassed how our friends would react, and I dont want to make permanent decisions on temporary feelings. I love him, but I feel so upset and hate this.",angry

"Very long... sorry :/ 

When I was younger I used to have issues with anger. Mostly due to being a teenager and growing up in an abusive home. My father is bipolar and has severe anger issues, most of which was verbal abuse, and rarely physical (mostly with my mother). 

I've thought I had outgrown my most toxic behavior after leaving and going to college. I'm definitely depressed and have anxiety and insecurities, I'm very well aware of that. But, for the most part life is good and I'm in a relationship and doing well in school. I have been more depressed the past few months, most of which I think is coming from my insecurities with myself and my relationship. Something will set me off and I'll just be upset or angry and go silent for the whole day. Something that's been happening a lot, mostly with my boyfriend. I've communicated to him about my family's past and how I'm doing now. But after being with my family for the holidays, I'm so concerned I'm the problem.

Yesterday I got angry with my sister for reasons and today I got into a fight with my brother. He's staying with me over school break and I had asked him to do a very simple favor which he didn't do correctly. I was openly upset and was murmuring to myself that I didn't understand how he did that and how I thought he couldn't do anything right. I felt bad for this right after, but I was really upset. I talked to him about, or at least tried to, but he got mad at me for being rude (he was bothered by the murmuring) and that I'm always angry about something. That my anger always lasts all day and that he just doesn't even try to involve himself. Which is fair. But, I feel like I'm at my worst with my siblings, always. Now that I'm in my first relationship I'm worried I have an issue with anger and letting go.

I have a tendency to hold onto things and not letting it go. I used to be very loud about my anger, but when I'm with anyone but family I generally just go silent. A behavior I've developed over time I guess (I think it's from me trying to not be like my dad who was always angry and very verbal about it but idk) Even with my bf I always just go silent and it just takes time for me to start talking. With my family it feels the opposite. I try to be quiet but I can't, there's this rage. It's like they don't understand I'm upset and that my anger is valid. But after talking to my brother today I feel like I have more anger issues than I know. Apparently to him this has always been a constant problem. I don't know. He also has issues of his own which he won't address, which don't really help when I'm trying to be confrontational/trying to talks things over to move past fighting. 

I don't know. Sorry this is so long, I was crying earlier and it just kind of helps to write this out. I don't want to be like my dad and I don't think I am, it just feels like I'm always attacked if I get angry. Maybe I'm just in the wrong. I don't want to play victim, I just feel like I'm always upset about something but I try to not take it out on other people. Idk dudes :/",angry

"While driving to the market (with my 18month old, sick baby with a fever) a car was trying to jump across 2 lanes to get to the freeway. I'm a retard and pulled into the middle of the intersection when I could have just waited. There was space for the car to jump across, and I gave a little honk and waved my arm so he could go.. WELL this jerk decided it would be funny to stay put so I (the idiot in the intersection) couldnt go anywhere. Being a little aggressive, I held on to the horn, so the jerk could ..  idk be annoyed or something stupid that I cant even find a justification for. After like 2 cycles of the lights he finally moved, but he tricked me! He smashed on his brakes..

 - what I did next is absolutely one of the the dumbest things I have ever done and I'm ashamed of myself for this and I know I  didnt help the situation, instead I made it worse- 

so he smashed on his brakes, i did NOT crash into him. I held the horn again. His passengers got out of the car, came to my passenger side door and started knocking on the window, and tried to open my door a few times.. I gently let my car tap his car, threw my car into a lower gear and PUSHED HIS CAR WITH MINE.. 

I am an idiot. I immediately knew I messed up. Put my car in park. And dialed 911. His passenger was still trying to get into my car, still knocking on the window trying to get my attention. I didnt open windows or even yell or talk to anyone involved. I just wanted to get to the market and buy medicine for my sick baby. 

The passengers and the driver (3 people)  all got out of the truck and were recording on their phones all while laughing at the situation. Like, these deranged idiots were amused by holding me up, holding traffic up, and they were amused by what just happened. I let the police dispatch know the situation. I told them what I did. And when the 3 guys realized i was on the phone they hopped in their car and SLOWLY drove off. 

I gave the dispatch the plate # the car description and a description of the guys and she advised me to let them drive away and to get to my destination.. she stood on the phone with me until they were gone and until I was ready to hang up. 

I was freaking out. I let her know there was not any damage to their car, I explained exactly what I did in detail. And she told me to just get away from that car. I did just that, there doesn't seem to be damage to my car. I'm hoping I dont get ticketed, and im hoping those guys dont report damages to their car and give my plate #. Idk if they could find me like that, I hope not though.

I realize that I didn't help by honking for so long or by pushing their car. I should have done everything differently. I am so ashamed for how I acted and I need to really figure out how to get help and learn how to deescalate situations or keep my cool while things are going on.",angry
"I work in customer service and have shitty coworkers who underperform regularly. I work as an outsourced customer service rep. Basically my parent company is contracted to provide customer service for their company. I am pissed off and trying to keep my cool because I have a violent streak when very angry. And I mean might kill or seriously injure kind of anger. I grew up in a conflict ridden family. I learned Muay Thai and sent my father to the hospital when I was in highschool. He was abusive and my mom is a schizo. I broke his arm and elbowed him so hard that I made a bleeding gash in his head. He didn't press charges, I don't really know why, maybe out of fear or regret of what a crappy father he was, and didn't want me in jail. Basically, I didn't end up going to jail. I know I am capable and when angered severely, violent. I have a 2 coworkers who I personally have know from years from being in school. They used to date. I was once friends with them, but then they crossed the line. One of them disrespects people at every chance the get and acts macho when they're an immature punk. Probably got brain damage cause they were in a car accident that messed them up pretty bad. A very good friend of mine was the driver and he everyone turned on him because of that. The guy was not wearing his seatbelt and would not put it on. All other occupants were fine. Skater dude wanna be rebel type. Anyway, I am desensitized to most insults due to my ass of a father, but he hit a nerve one day. 

He said something out of line and I flipped on him. He said sorry real quick and ran off like a scared kid.
I treat people how I want to be treated. I never hurled insults at this guy. Truth be told, he has mental issues and all that. But when I've been pushed too far, I'm done. He never offered a proper apology because he was too scared I guess. So i left it alone cause I didn't want a friend like that.

Now the other coworker crossed many boundaries outside of work. The short of it, they are a narcissistic and compulsive liar. They're really shady and people get suckered in by them initially. They're the type who act super interested in you or excited, so you think you feel good around them. But they talk over you, act like they know it all and always gotta talk about themselves. 

Both these people pull shady shit all the time. Ditch work. Get off phones and abandoning other responsibilities all the time. Do their job poorly so other reps gotta fix it. Their poor work jeopardizes everyone elses as the other company could discontinue their contract with my parent company.
The wanna-be-badass said he doesn't care if our program gets shutdown. Of course he doesn't because he still lives with mommy and daddy and going to school. The prick.

Fast forward a few months after her crossed the line.
I'm one of the high performing reps and my customer satisfaction rating is high. I find that he and his ex are solving tickets under me and my gf who works there. These tickets are getting a bad rating. Ratings affect our bonuses too. Both my gf and my ratings are actually too good to be affected, but the fact that they belligerently attempted to do that pisses me off so much.

We let a supervisor know and my district manager for the parent company knows how bad they are. They're keeping them for know from what I have been told. I confronted the wanna be badass and told him not to mess with me. He said something I can't even remember because he was too chicken to speak up to me. 

But he says lowkey remarks outloud to his ex and our other coworker. Both of them are cowards.

I have so much rage and anger that I might just assault this trash. He is jeopardizing other people's jobs and does not care. I despise people like him. 
I get so close. I feel my blood boiling. I also always carry something on me, like a pocketknife. I get those urges.

I'm a somewhat practiced martial artist and I'm also pretty fit. I can really mess this guy up if I tried. I know i can't for legality sake. But he tried some slick shit to sabotage my gf and I, and he jeopardizes the jobs of others. So does his shit ex. She just fucks around and gives half assed work. She spells, ""courtesy"" as ""curtsy"". Go back to school. A curtsy is like a bow.

To be honest both are to cowardly to do anything directly. I am certain if they did, it would go badly for them. I grew up in a home where you talked shit and got hit. If you gonna talk shit, you better bring it.

I'm trying to be civil. Thanks to my girl I don't cuss as much, and I'm less destructive. But this shit is puting me over the edge. This shit is about to put me in jail because they should be fired but I'm told ""not yet"". 

If they keep messing around or try some dumb shit again, I don't think I can stop myself. I have a strong bloodlust. Playing with someone's money is dangerous. So how can they be so stupid?

All I want is to be left alone and focus on my stuff.
I also don't want to be cleaning up after someone.

We‚Äôre casual but we agreed on exclusivity and as the title suggests, he slept with someone else and I caught them together. 

Now, I believe due to our circumstance I deserve a face to face talk. We work together, we have shared intimate moments, feelings. He even bought me a birthday present within a month of us being together and it was a really thoughtful present. Something that showed he had been listening to me. 
He rejected my idea of a face to face conversation saying it has no purpose. I tried to explain to him that it‚Äôs not very fair on me, I have to basically deal with this myself with no explanation from him. I tried to say that we work together and we should really try and make it as civil as possible.

"My mother is the ""spoil to show and demand love"" kind of person and I hate her for it. I love her, but damn I hate her for it.

We got a puppy recently, sort of recently at least. And rather, my sister did, but we take care of her a lot whenever she has long work hours for extended amount of days. The dog is like family to us too, and I like her. But I hate seeing how mom spoils her, like she did with me and my younger brother. I feel like it's all my mom knows to do, and doesn't see the harm in it at all, even when I've brought it up. 

I'll give you an example. The dog wasn't allowed in the livingroom and upstairs. Mostly because of the stairs but also because my dad doesn't like getting dog hair everywhere, and frankly I agree. And really, it's a fairly simple thing right? Well that didn't last long.

The dog is very social and likes to follow us around (cutie) and so, when she hit the rebellious pupper phase, she would also try to sneak with us to go to these forbidden areas. No problem, we would just tell her not to. Simple as that. My mom however thought, ah to heck with it, and gave up. The puppy first conquered the upstairs. Now she has taken the living room. 

I got so fucking angry cause all that work was for nothing now, the puppy got away with it with my mom now so there was no point trying to teach her out of it anymore. Even my dad had to give up because the puppy would just do it behind his back, because now my mom had allowed her there.

It's fucking annoying. Same thing no matter what she does.

When I was a kid my older sister challenged me to go a month without candy. I had almost done it too and I was beginning to be so proud of myself - I mean that was a big thing for an 9 year old me, especially since my sister would buy me a game I had wanted if I were to win the bet. A week to go and I was having one bad day and I complained loudly in the livingroom and my mom heard me. She knew about the bet, but she just couldn't be the support I needed, no. She gave me a bag of chips saying ""Well it isn't candy"" - and I was like heck yeah that's true! But my sister was livid, and said I lost.

My mom bought me the game anyway.

At the time I was happy but now that memory has become something that keeps me up at night. I know it's so stupid, and this complaint is so stupid, like boo hoo my mom loves me, boo hoo she bought me a game for no reason at all. But really, I just wish instead I had a mom who had pushed me to do more things myself. Like maybe if she had encouraged me during that bet, or heaven forbid during anything, maybe I wouldn't be the pathetic waste of a human being I am today. I am in my twenties, I have no idea what I want with my life. I feel anxious just thinking about stuff like that cause I have no idea how anything works, how life works. I wish anyone would have cared enough to help me grow into a good person and not just idk.

I know it's not just her fault, and I made my own decisions too but I feel like I can't even bother looking at her. I don't think I've ever had a serious talk with her. It makes me so angry and sad at the same time.",angry

Instead of just you know answering the damn question they'll go over how your proposed soltuion is so **WRONG** and how much of an **IDIOT** you are but they won't say it's wrong or that you're an idiot. They do it subtly. Sentences like ""why would the answer be that"" or ""No....?????""

DO NOT MISS A DOSE OF THE BLUE PILL!!! I miss my manic highs, I still have depressive lows, which I embrace. I am considered brilliant, but useless.

Then come up with a new proposal and start over ad nauseam and would still have a 1 in a 1000 chance of getting published.

I just wish that guy was capable of empathy cuz I swear what he does is so fucking messed up. I watched the Chris Hansen interviews and I've seen a lot of onision all through out my life and the guy disgusts me because he lives in a fantasyland where he thinks whatever is going on inside his head is normal and okay when it's not. I just wish that guy would get off the internet, stay away from minors and stop being the R. KELLY of YouTube. I swear this guy needs some serious help and I don't think there's a cure for people like him, but I want to hope that people like him are capable of possibly getting better if they just put their ego aside and seek proffesional help no matter how hard it seems to change. But unfortunatley most people like that won't change because they don't want to and because their mental health makes them feel like whatever they are doing is normal. :( I just feel so upset that this guy can easily have access to minors to manipulate and I just hate the fact he has gotten away with abusing people behind the scenes for so long without people realizing it. I'm grateful Chris Hansen and the FBI is trying to investigate and expose him for what he is. I seriously hope that justice is served because what he put his victims through is seriously evil.

But I wish we could have all of that in our society without suffering and pain happening so much. :/ I just don't know how to feel about it all. I think a world without people being harmed like that would be a much better place but at the same time idk if that's even possible.

"I used to be really bad when it came to anger management, I constantly got in fights becuase of my temper and always threw out shitty remarks at people when pissed off. An example of this would be when I got pissed off enough to wedgie someone off of the ground completely, rip out parts of their hair, drop them and then kick them. Naturally, I got in quite a bot of trouble for that.

Over the last two or so years I like to think I've levelled off and I'm not nearly as bad as I once was. However, certain people are starting to really test my patience and self control by their continued existence. As someone who is naturally choleric this just drives me up the fucking wall.

Most of it is down to this one single guy. I have to have very regular contact with him, not just because he's always messaging me in some way, but also through the fact I have to see him for hours nearly every day. Not only does he not take cues to fuck off, which includes the very direct ""Get the fuck out of my face"" (Fun fact, I legitimately cannot stand to look him in the face) but it also includes the most inane and stupid ass questions I've ever heard. The guy isn't an idiot but the amount of shit he spews trying to make himself sound smart makes him come across as that. There was one time at a group presentation that he was the speaker and he refused to look at the notes and all the prep done by the others and proceeded to did it all from memory, needless to say that didn't go down well for anyone. He's also arrogant beyond belief but that's a separate matter.

I know that in all walks of life you meet people who will annoy you, however, this genuinely makes me angry. I'm not even going to go into detail about how he tells me about his sex life despite knowing that A) I have said multiple times I don't want to hear it, and B) That I am asexual and don't care in the slightest if you show me pictures.

I simply feel like one day my patience is going to break. I've taken to literally punching walls in order to calm myself down after meeting or talking to him. It drives me that fucking crazy.",angry

"Not everyone, but people really annoy me sometimes and I often enjoy fantasies in my head of myself telling people off for being inconsiderate. I really get this feeling on the road. People like to tailgate my ass and I can‚Äôt help but imagine stopping my truck beating the ever living shit out of the entitled asshole behind me within an inch of their life and climbing back into my truck and continuing on. Now obviously I‚Äôm a sane logical person and I would never do this. I would never risk getting in a fight unless I was forced. But boy does it make me feel better to imagine it in my head. I never tailgate people unless they really deserve it like if they go 20 mph under and even then I try to let up as much as I can. I actually have respect for other drivers and I see the good in everyone and try not to ruin anyone‚Äôs day. Someone goes incredibly slow in front of me? I think in my head that they must be old or lost and I ease up most of the time. I never tailgate if someone is going the speed limit like every other asshole does to me though. Now I used to be a speeder. Several warnings from cops and an eventual nearly 200 dollar ticket made me change my ways. Now I always go the legal speed on the road. I do not go under the speed limit. I either go the exact speed limit or the 5mph over that is allowed. I usually go the 5mph over because I‚Äôm an actual nice person even to impatient dipshits behind me and because I just don‚Äôt want to deal with them. Now even going to maximum speed limit there are still people that insist to tailgate my fucking ass as if I‚Äôm going to speed up and get a fucking ticket for them or they think I‚Äôm fucking scared of a little mini-van hitting the back of my truck that is 3 times it‚Äôs size. I don‚Äôt speed up for anyone past the legal limit and I can tell it pisses people off but I just don‚Äôt get it. Cops do the same fucking thing because they are above the law and can do what they want. They actually ride your ass because they want you to speed. I hate them too.

" I am a 26 year old guy from Portugal, and I've never been in long relationships.  
Just to give a little bit of context, I had one Girlfriend, for 3 years, that sadly died (cancer) and I was with her till the end. She died when we were 18, it was sudden, and it had an effect on me, I realized I turned to food whenever I felt bad or stressed after that and gained a lot of weight (I was never really fit to begin with) and I became chubby.

For a lot of years I became the fat ""jester"", always trying to make people smile, often at my expense, and I told myself girls were not interested in me just because of how I looked, and since I didn't care how I looked, I was fine with it, I had come to terms with being alone.

A couple of years back, I was having trouble breathing after going up a few stairs, so I decided to join a Gym, not for aesthetics, for wellness... but of course I dropped weight, I was no longer ""morbidly obese"" and became what I am calling ""Socially accepted dad-body-like chubby"".  
With it I regained some confidence... but still not enough to search for girls IRL.

So after that, a new girl joined our WoW guild, and we have a discord server, and there, we usually post photos of our selfies every friday (we call it Selfie Friday)

That Girl was a 28 yo Teacher from the other side of the Continent (she is from Romania), and I didn't post photos of myself in discord, so she didn't know how I looked like... she was cool to play with, We started talking to each other every day. Not a day went by when we didn't chat a bit, and we always said Good Morning and Good Night to each other... I started to have a little crush on her.... but my lack of confidence made me not tell her.

She eventually told me she made peace with her boyfriend (they had a little feud) and that I unknowingly helped them make peace, this before Valentines... I thought ""Great!, I'm an idiot, but it's not like I would have a chance with her anyway"" so I just repressed my feelings for her.

She told me how, after she had a break from her boyfriend, she met a guy online too, and he was supposed to visit her, bought tickets and everything, and cancelled at the last time telling her he met someone... and that made her sad.

She told me somedays I made her feel special... that I made her feel glad she met me... but of course, I thought I was in the friendzone already, so I just resigned to my place and kept being myself, though I did like her telling me I made her feel special.

Then one week, months after, she tells me she has a crush on a friend... but she is shy and can't say anything to him because she is afraid she is going to ruin everything. I told her I liked somebody too and I was scared because I knew nothing would happen, we both diverted the theme of the conversation... and it took me one month to gather the courage, to tell her I like her, but I did it in the most ""beta"" unromantic way possible, over discord text... and I will write exactly what I said:  
"" This is not something I‚Äôd share with someone I didn‚Äôt trust, but I feel like I can trust you with anything, plus you know what it is like to be overweight, people don‚Äôt look at you the same.Like, for instance, the guy you spoke about that you have a crush on, I‚Äôd bet he doesn‚Äôt have weight problems... not calling women shallow it‚Äôs just how it works most times...""  
And after that she told me she thinks the guys she has a crush on just thinks he has a problem, she posted even more photos of when she was overweight herself, so I said

""Well... you honestly look beautiful in both pictures, and I have little time to write with my boss beside me all morning but ... I think there‚Äôs something you deserve to know and I hope it won‚Äôt change our chats, or that we will stop talking to each other or anything like that ... the person I said I was afraid to develop feelings for was you ... back when we first started talking I had no idea what you looked like beside a photo with 3 students and I didn‚Äôt know what had happened to you ... and then you told me . And I feel dumb, and stupid, but like you said we can‚Äôt control our feelings. I know very well you‚Äôd never think of me like that. Sorry to have disappointed you but please know everything I said about you, I meant it. Believe me it wasn‚Äôt easy to tell you this, so with it what you will, just know I will miss our chats if we stop them :/ I can still be your friend like I was trying to be if you let me.""

After that she told me it's obvious she was talking about me .. it's me she has a crush on. And that if I want we can take babysteps, but she needs time, and she has a boyfriend so she can't do anything now. I foolishly agreed.

Like, a Month passed, and she hits me with this bomb:

""You know, you are a special person to me and as we always said, as long as we are honest to eachother, none of us will get hurt. My boyfriend gave me the ring. We didn't establish a wedding date or So, but I feel like you should know this. I don't want to hide things, I am not that kind of person. You knew I had a boyfriend, so I truly hope that doesn't change things. It just felt like I had to tell you this.i still wanna talk to youPoint Is, I don't want this to make me lose you I couldn't lie to you(...) I am not marriedI will understand if you don't wanna talk to me (...) Oh, I didn't answer to his question, I do have a crush on you, That's why I didn't answer ""

And I responded, honestly, and I meant it, with

"" I trusted you, and I still do 100% ... but I have to protect myself with these feelings ... So, answer me this:If you do tell him yes, will you tell me ? If you say no to him, and it's because of me ... Will you be able to live with it ?"" ... she told me I would be the first to know her decision ... then I kept on by saying:

"" You did well to do that (that being telling me about it) ... really ... and I never ever wanted to put you in a position like this but feelings are feelings and what I feel for you is real. the feelings exist. Whatever you decide I will have to deal with and that part is out of my hands. (the following part may seem stupid but since we are being honest and speaking what is on our mind) : I can't back away for now ... how could I ? what man would I be if I didn't fight a little for what I think is best for me ? But I also want you to make a conscious decision and I will respect whatever you do 100%. Just to close this I want you to be certain of one thing... I do like you. ""

She told me she was amazed by my answer ... and we got closer ... and closer ... but never really close ...

I gave her the time she needed... she made plans to go on vacation with her best friend to Spain, and asked if I could meet her ... I said sure, of course!

Things were ok ... then months and months passed and no progression.

I sent her a few gifts for her birthday, 1 month in advance so she would get them on time, and since my birthday is 2 weeks before hers, I told her, I didn't want anything but a picture of her face for my birthday, since that would make me happier than anything she could buy.

Then .... she kind of forgot it ... and sent it a few days later ... no big deal...

Then one more month, and I had waited 4 months, I asked her what I was to her, and she took offence... she told me I was pushing her, and it was not ok... and turned cold on me ... dumb me called every flower shop the weekend after that, in Romanian... asking if they could do a bouquet of her favourite flowers (white roses) and if it was ok for me to pay via Paypal, one accepted, and there it was, the first bouquet I ever sent a girl was to one 3000km away, just to say sorry.

She then tells me her boyfriend is getting screened for cancer, and she can't make a decision until she gets the results, then the results were good, and she said nothing, took offence when I pointed out she decided to keep things the same and I was getting tired... for her to give me something in return ... she went cold again, made me feel like a monster, for like a whole month ...  
Then a mutual friend shows me a text, she told everyone she is engaged, and sent a photo of the ring to everyone in the guild but me... I called her on it, she convinced me it was so people would stop coming on to her on the guild and so people would stop asking her when she was getting married, but she was not engaged yet ... I ate it up because I wanted to hear that... made peace with her ...

She then tells me her appartment she was renting with him was sold, so she would find a place for her own ... she tells me she went looking for appartments, but they all had problems (too expensive, in a bad part of town, owner tried to set a date with her, etc etc) ... meanwhile her boyfriend buys a house ... guess who decided to move in ... Her... she decided to move in with him ... I was, obviously, not ok with the decision, and she told me it was ""only for convenience, she needed a place"". I thought it wasn‚Äôt really my place to be angry at that‚Ä¶ but I obviously never believed that excuse.

So one day ... months after... I am still bitter that she is with him ... her mom gets sick ... and I started to notice, everytime I talk about ""us"" she changed the subject to something else ... on the third day she does it, I on purpose start only talking about us, and she dodges everything... until I point it out and tell her I'm not an idiot ... she could just tell me she doesn't want to talk about us because she doesn't like me it's clear ... changing the subject everytime was dumb, and that I didn't deserve that.

She explodes, tries to say she was doing that only because she was worried about her mom ... so I kindly point out it was not the first time ... when her boyfriend was getting screened for cancer she was cold to me too and told me she would make a decision about things after the results ... and the lack of decision was decision enough ... I was not good enough ...

She explodes and says she is ""So done"" with me ... that she wants to end things, that she tried to see me as more than a friend but now she can't see me as more than that ... so I blocked her on both discord and bnet.

Blocked her, cried a bit like the wuss I am, finished my work, got home, showered, went to the bar, had a few drinks ... called the one girl that liked me but I didn't play with her because I wasn't ready for a relationship and didn't want anything with her and basically was not my usual self, I was craving to feel desired, to feel almost loved, I wanted something, a connection to someone, even if meaningless, because I was feeling like trash ... I told her ""I am down to having fun tonight, if you are down too, I am at X bar close to your house, you have 1 hour to get here before I am completely drunk""... the girl came, had a few drinks too... then I went to her house ... we did the ""horizontal dance with no pants""... but I didn't feel as good as I was supposed too ...

I stayed the night because I couldn't drive, I had drank a whole lot...

In the morning she calls me over facebook ... I am still in that girls house, I texted saying ""Do not fucking do that, I don't want to hear your voice""

She keeps calling and calling ... I drive out and park neaby and ... answered a call... she told me to yell at her, scream at her, get everything off my chest but she was sorry for the previous day, she didn't mean it ... so I just told her ... one, I came from a girls house that appreciated me more in a night than she did in all the months we had been in this bullshit ... I called out how she was treating me as just an option while I was doing things for her ...  
She got angry that I slept with someone ... and I pointed out ""But you live with your Boyfriend! you sleep on the same bed! Fuck you!"" and she said my argument had no power because I knew about it. And I told her ""Sure, I knew about it, and im supposed to be ok with it just because I knew ? how do you think I feel every night wondering if the woman I fell for is being fucked by another guy and I am just the option?"" ... but eventually, she managed to convince me we could work things out ... her mom was seriously bad ... but we could work things out like we always did ... I once again, foolishly followed .... until the very next week she calls me out for being ""cold"" to her ... and I told her, she had been cold for me for a month before ... she started accusing again so I said... ""Ok... it is done, I am done, My mom didn't raise her some second hand option ... someone will know my worth, you obviously don't ... you never did..."" and I remembered her boyfriends birthday was that Thursday(and this was a Monday) so I told her ""Oh, give your precious boyfriend a gift, accept the proposal, it's free, you get what you want, and that is if you didn't lie about not being engaged already, and you only have to remember to DO IT ON TIME THIS TIME!""

She then proceeds to change everything she ever said, that I was not the reason she didn't accept the proposal yet, that she didn't want to meet me because I was a stranger, that I never really done stuff for her, and what I did she didn't ask for, that I never helped her, that I never made her feel special.

She told me in a few weeks she would try to have a baby with him to seal the deal.

So ... I did what I should have done a long time ago and blocked her for good.

I know I should be glad she is not in my life anymore... in a way I know I am better off without that shit ... but some part of me keeps me awake at night wondering what was truth and what wasn't, wondering why she would lie, what did she gain? apart from a few things I sent and the attention she got ... would a person really be this shitty with nothing to gain but some attention ? Attention she wouldn't need from me because, for one thing, she had a fucking boyfriend who she clearly cared about, so it was not like he wasn't giving her enough, for another thing, looking the way she does and having the brains she has, shecould easily get it from other guys Have I been so naive to think that a person wouldn't toy with another's feelings just for attention ? Why can't I just forget her ? Why did she do this to me ? Why me ? Why ?

All of my familial anger gets bad around the holidays. This year, I'm having my own thanksgiving and christmas and I am pretty excited about it.

Today I wrote asking for help on an exercise and this dude comes out all aggressive and shit and starts telling me I never use the group or collaborate in it (which is fair, I don't, but I don't profit from it either). Then he said ""besides, you don't even mix with us anymore"" BITCH we have different timetables, + my daily schedule makes it almost impossible to be with all of them at the same time.

"In the several months I have used this site, I have had encounters with people I have disagreed with. All of them die down eventually, like they should. But this one guy from the UK is an absolute asshole. He posted a question on r/askreddit, asking people who have written horror if they've ever written something that creeped them out personally, and what it was. I answer, and he responds with his own opinion. Nowhere in this question was OP's opinion or commentary mentioned or sought after, but this guy wound up making it his absolute mission to counter everything that came out of me typing with comments that insulted my intelligence, smeared my craft, and made me out to be a mother's boy. I told him I bet $20 he'd freeze up and stumble over his words if he met me face to face and said the things he was so comfortable with telling me. He doesn't even know me, but he made it easy for me to deduce that he's a bully and a jerk who has never known pleasure a day in his life. This wasn't someone offering a mere unsolicited opinion, to be honest, this was a full-scale assault on my person, and every time I defended myself, he would not let up. I eventually just told him to ""have fun being fucking miserable"" and ""I hope it's really worth it"". People are way too comfortable with being pricks nowadays.

"This story takes place back in August 26 of 2016.

I had recently turned 19, and just graduated high school with nearly a full ride to College. I was super excited, and looking forward to a new chapter of my life.
It was near the end of summer, but I live in a desert where the peak could reach 115¬∞ F. 
About three days before college was about to start, I got into a huge argument with my mother about the fact that I was dating my high school sweetheart, whom im still dating to this day, and she was trying for months to convince me to break up with him. 

My mother hadnt met him at the time, and it was for good reason. She is extremely controlling of everything i do, and was essentially brainwashing me. She would tell me on a daily basis that becauses i rarely put on make up, pull back my hair, or because i liked video games that he would break up with me. That because i was 2 years older than him, he would find someone his ""own"" age after getting bored with me. 
She did this for nearly  a year straight, and if i dazed off she would say she cant believe her own daughter wouldnt listen to what she has to say.
My mom was convinced that in order for me to succeed, and do well in college that she had to break us up.
Keep in mind, i was a straight A student, i never went out to party, drink, or get high. I didnt even go to friends' birthday party. All i ever did was school, chores, homework, work, and babysit my two younger siblings. I would get achievements and awards from high school because i did so well and my mom would constantly brag about this to her family as if it were her achievements. 
My mom would constantly belittle me, and made me believe nobody would care if i died because i wasnt important enough to care about. 

During out argument, i just snapped.

 I told her I was an adult and can decide for myself on who i date. She should be supporting me in my decision because she's my mother and should want me to be happy. 

She was surprised i finally stood up for myself after years of taking her abuse. But exploded in anger sayimg how dare i talk to her in that manner! That she was my mother and i needed to respect her as so and do what she says! And if i didnt then i shouldnt bother talking to her, and to forget about having a way to school because she wasnt going to help me anymore. 

She gave me the silent treament for three days straight. If i tried talking to her, she just pretend she didnt hear me. I tried everything to even apologizing, she wouldnt accept it unless i broke off my relationship. 
I cried myself to sleep those three nights. 
On the first day of college, i had no way to get to school. I didnt have enough for a bus pass, and my boyfriend was nice enough to ask him mom, but she hadnt given a clear answer. 

My university was 11 miles away from my house. 

But i did have my legs and my bike. 

I woke up at 7 am, my class started at 10:00 am. If i biked all the way i could make it at 10:00 am and go to all my classes.
And so i go. It wasnt that bad for the first 45 minutes.  

The heat was starting to set in, and i had some water with me. Until i got lost and started panicking. I wasnt thinking straight and my cell reception was too poor to use data. I had never been to this side of town, so i called my boyfriend who gave me instructions through google maps. 

I got to class 15 mins late, sweating, exhausted, and sore. I manage to stay awake long enough to get through my classes and its around 2:30 pm when im done for the day. 
I was tired, granted but excited! I couldnt wait to start on my assignments. 

Going back was harder than getting there. It was much hotter than the morning about 110¬∞F and little to no shade. I had finished my water through the first half hour, and the bike was overheating to where i could only touch the handles without burning myself. 

About halfway home, its now 5 pm, and im on the verge of passing out. 
I threw up from exhaustion and there was white spots in my vision. I had to take a break, so i went into a local shop and filled up on water for about 20 mins. I wanted to day to end. 

My boyfriend was on the phone with me during the whole walk. My mom hadnt once texted me nor called me. 

I couldnt bike anymore, my legs were going numb and there were too many hills to go up that just tired me out more.

I FINALLY make it home at 6:30 pm. My mom was in nice cold Air conditioning watching tv, now yelling at where ive been. That she was worried, and accusing me of being out with my boyfriend all day and lying about going to college.
I was hot, and too tired to deal with her. And said i was going to shower. 
She said ""No, you have to stay here and watch your sister. Im going to the gym.""

I snapped""No, im going to shower and then ill watch her. Ive been walking ALL day, and i smell like death.""

She scolds"" thats YOUR fault, if you had broken up with your boyfriend like i told you too, you wouldve had a ride to school!"" 
I was done. I was going up the stairs when she yells""GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.""

I respond, confused,""What?""
She continues,"" You heard me! I dont want you living here anymore! Get your stuff and get out of MY house!!!!"" 
I was upset, shocked. I didnt know what to do, i started freaking out. 
She yells""IF YOURE NOT OUT OF THIS HOUSE IN 10 MINS, IM CALLING THE COPS!"" 
I start bawling, and start packing. I didnt have anywhere to go, i didnt know what to do. 

My boyfriend was STILL on the phone with me. He heard everything. He was trying to calm me down, telling me it would be okay. To go over to his house and we would figure it out. 
So... i did. 

I went to his house with my backpack. Some clothes, my 3ds, my schoolwork. Whatever i could carry on my back. I wasnt allowed to take my bike because she bought it. She didnt care where i went, just wanted me gone. 
After another 40 minutes of walking, i knock on my boyfriend's door and before i even say anything he just hugs.

Later than night, i talked with my boyfriend's parent and they said that i can stay the night but ill have to talk to my mom in the morning. 
Before i could even say thank you, my phone starts ringing. 
Its my mom.
Shes yelling at me, demanding to know where i am. 
I tell her where i am, in complete disbelief.
She gets more infuriated saying why did i go there. They dont care about me, why am i giving them my problems, when its my fault for missing college for spending time with my boyfriend. 
I told her again i did go to college and have the homework to show her,"" why did you kick me out??""

She states coldly,"" i wanted you to be at a McDonald's  on your knees begging me to let you come back. You need me. Youre nothing without me."" 

I couldnt see from how hard i was crying, my boyfriend takes the phone and hangs up. 

His parents heard the whole thing, and they let me stay at their house for nearly 3 months before i get contacted again by my mom. 

TL:DR my mom demands i break up with my boyfriend, i dont, and walk to college. She gets mad, and makes me homeless to prove a point. 

Theres more to this story but thats for another day. I didnt share my story to get pity points, but im still about about it and NEEDED to get this off my chest.",angry
I'm just here to read why other people are pissed off. I can't fucking sleep. I have a worker that has a mouth on him.. I fucking had enough and yelled at him today. I'm usually a peaceful person so it bothers me. Good night.,angry
"Because of financial reasons, my bf and I decided to move in with his parents in a totally new state. It was fine with me at first because I really was looking forward to getting to know his family, especially his mom who remarried recently.

Cue in step-dad. So this guy is super religious and possibly sexist, so much so that the mom told me not to wear shorts around him on our first day arriving. Obviously, fuck that. The step-dad can be nice, and he has anxiety and depression like me, but man, there‚Äôs something about him that pisses me off that no amount of mental-health-relatable-ness can ease any of my anger.

As soon as we meet, he doesn‚Äôt make any eye contact with me and doesn‚Äôt include me in conversations even though I‚Äôm trying to go along with their conversation. I brought this up to my bf and he says we‚Äôll observe. Oh, I‚Äôm observing alright. So far, I see him trying to be a dad to my bf, which is fine and all, more power to him. But when he doesn‚Äôt try to get along with me just because he thinks I‚Äôm just the girlfriend, that‚Äôs where he‚Äôs wrong. My family and I have spent money and time on him to make sure he‚Äôs well taken care of before he even married his mom. We‚Äôve been together for almost 4 fucking years. I deserve a little bit more respect. Fuck him.

He goes through my bf‚Äôs mom when he has rules he wants to set because he‚Äôs still cautious with us. That‚Äôs fine, because unlike him, my bf‚Äôs mom isn‚Äôt a twat.

So we discussed rent. His initial offer was $300 for a room for a 2bdrm $1200 apartment, and I, not my bf, raised it to $500 to offer to help with electricity and internet. We all went apartment hunting together and was satisfied with a $1250 2bdrm. Our room in this one was almost the same size as theirs and isn‚Äôt connected to their bedroom (for noise reasons), so no complaints. 

Lo and fucking behold, they decide to go with a $1400 3bdrm last minute without consulting us (because apparently we decided to pay more) and the room they ended up giving us was small, like 1 person small. They gave us the option to get the bigger room but it was connected to theirs and they‚Äôre concerned with our noise (we‚Äôre both gamers), so we decided to stay with the smaller room. At this point, it‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt even give us a choice.

Next, they refused to get the internet. I was fuming at this point so I talked to my bf‚Äôs mom and she said she doesn‚Äôt remember me talking about the internet being included in our rent. I talked to my bf and he says he wasn‚Äôt there during the conversation so he initially decided to pay for the internet by himself, which I then offered later on to help pitch in. The reason why the parents didn‚Äôt want to pay for the internet is because the step-dad ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need it‚Äù, and yet here he is enjoying it like he‚Äôs helping pay for it.

My bf‚Äôs mom wanted to get a job but the step-dad didn‚Äôt want her to get one, so she stayed at home mainly to do the chores. My bf and I still did our chores but she would sometimes do them herself for us while we‚Äôre working, which we both appreciated, but I know irritates the step-dad. Take note, we don‚Äôt ask her to, she just does it. 

Then there was the incident where the mom‚Äôs family was at the apartment. The mom had no problem opening our door without permission when she wanted to relay some messages from the step-dad, but she didn‚Äôt bother to invite me to eat with them while I was getting ready for work in our room. I only found out when I went out of the room and saw them eating. I said hi and nobody responded. They knew I was home. I had greeted them all before this. I think it‚Äôs only manners to invite someone to eat and acknowledge their presence.

Then there‚Äôs the cooking at night. Apparently, the step-dad woke up in the middle of the night because I was washing dishes and got mad, so now we‚Äôre no longer allowed to cook past 9pm. My shifts at work end past 9pm, and we‚Äôre trying to save money by not buying food outside. He also doesn‚Äôt want us leaving dishes in the sink before we go to bed. Wtf. So I guess I‚Äôll starve, you piece of shit.

The most recent one is not being allowed to touch the thermostat. Our room gets hot despite it being almost winter. He turned up the heat recently and I had a hard time going to sleep because if the heat, so I changed the thermostat to cool and turned the fan on. We get a text the next day telling us to ‚Äúnot change the setting‚Äù. I was fed up at this point and asked him what happens if it‚Äôs too hot and I can‚Äôt sleep like the other night? He tells me to do things I‚Äôve already done that same night and he explained that he does that to conserve electricity. 

Well, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have gotten a more expensive apartment, you asshat. I offered to raise our rent so we specifically can help with the bills. And if you weren‚Äôt comfortable with us paying $300, then maybe be more realistic about your fucking offer in the first place, you fucking piece of shit.

I‚Äôm honestly about to blow up. I don‚Äôt mind rules for as long as they make sense. These don‚Äôt. And honestly, with the way he‚Äôs been treating me and with some of his beliefs, I doubt I‚Äôll ever even try to get along with him.

I get we‚Äôre ‚Äúindebted‚Äù to them because they let us rent a room with them for cheap, but literally I feel like he‚Äôs power tripping at this point. 

I know I have the choice to leave but my bf wants to stay, and I‚Äôve had bad experiences with roommates before. I can definitely afford to find my own place now but I don‚Äôt know how to feel living in a completely different state on my own. It‚Äôs also really nice to be able to split the rent and bills.

I‚Äôm sincerely hoping that they don‚Äôt renew the lease next year so my bf and I can just find an apartment in our own.

Fuck this step-dad.",angry

"Im not sure if this counts as a rant, I dont mean it to be one, I just want to know if other people here feel this way. Often when I am feeling too stressed, depressed, etc, I dont breakdown in tears and hysterics (well sometimes I do) but often my panic attacks are full on anger fits. I dont take my anger out on others unless they're directly related to the problem, but I'm not good at containing my anger or focusing it on other things. And sometimes it just builds and builds and builds until I cant stop screaming angrily at myself or at nothing, and slamming things around me. But no one in my family comes to my aid to try and keep me from hurting myself. Or when I'm at school and seem frustrated or tired, no one asks what's wrong or offers their presence, but when I'm sobbing and blubbering, they're suddenly concerned. No one seems to care until I've worn myself out from anger and start crying relentlessly. People always treat anger as some dirty, disgusting emotion. I know unmanaged anger can become something worse, but hardly anyone seems interested in helping before it gets worse.",angry

What makes me so angry is that my academic career is over. Before the accident, I had mid 90s as my grades, I had a perfect attendance and was really getting somewhere. Then I got in the accident and began skipping for the first time. Not because I wanted to, but because of my body pain. I remember laying in bed crying because of how much my body hurt. Not only was my body damaged, my head was too, and I have truly never learned the same. All I needed was the accident report number to get treatment (so that they know I‚Äôm telling the truth), but my friend never gave it to me.

He constantly barks orders at me and expects me to comply. He is extremely strict. I feel like he doesn't listen to me at all when I tell him how I feel.

‚ÄúWhy does [company] make such shoddy products and expect customers to pay for it? Aren‚Äôt they renowned for quality?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you offer free repairs for problem X but not my specific issue? That‚Äôs soooo unfaaaaiiiirrr!!‚Äù

Highly advanced electronics cost money to make and money to fix that‚Äôs why!

Companies exist to make profits. And there‚Äôs no profit in doing free repairs. That‚Äôs why!

Here‚Äôs a radical notion: If you think the company you are buying from makes crappy quality products that break too easily- DON‚ÄôT BUY SHIT FROM THEM. 

And if you want to negotiate with the rep to whittle down the price or get a free repair, don‚Äôt go on a novel length tirade over text telling the rep how awful they are for charging you money and how awful the company is.

"Hi all, I‚Äôm not sure if this fits into this sub but I‚Äôm not sure if it should belong here for r/offmychest or r/rant but I‚Äôm gonna stick this here and if it doesn‚Äôt belong then my apologies I am just throughly annoyed right now. And before I begin i don‚Äôt intend to sound bitchy here but if I come off as it then so be it. 

So this happened a little while ago when I got a call from my seasonal job (have been doing this job for a year ish now) and it‚Äôs a new LM and the dress code is different (all black to white button up and black pants (not jeans)) and I went off complaining to friends about it bc it‚Äôs not a job where I need to look professional. Like, at all. It‚Äôs not a job where I need to look like I work a 9-5 office job, it‚Äôs literally just a temporary mall job. 

So I was complaining to a friend about it and she said I was overreacting and I don‚Äôt think I was but I was just annoyed by having to look professional for no damn reason. Our last LM didn‚Äôt care what we wore as long as it was all black. Meaning I could wear leggings and a hoodie and it would be fine. But having to actually dress up this time? Is annoying. Like don‚Äôt get me wrong I love dressing up and looking all put together but I do not want to do it for this job. If I worked at Pandora (y‚Äôknow the boujee jewelry store) sure I wouldn‚Äôt mind dressing like that bc that‚Äôs their aesthetic if you will. Very clean fancy looking store. But not my job. 

So I went on a little rant and ramble to her but she just gets on my last nerves sometimes and I want to just take every mean thing I keep away from her and tell it to her face but ofc I don‚Äôt bc I don‚Äôt wanna lose her as a friend. But jesus she gets on my last nerves sometimes. Every time something like this comes up she ALWAYS attacks me on the fact that I can‚Äôt drive. I can drive, I don‚Äôt have my license and I can‚Äôt get it bc quite frankly driving terrifies me. I get anxiety behind the wheel and I start to sweat in my palms and I‚Äôm very tense and not relaxed while driving. I‚Äôve cried driving before (in drivers ed, very intimidating instructor) and she‚Äôs cried MULTIPLE times while learning how to drive w her dad. It‚Äôs a cheap shot imo. 

She constantly comes for me and how I can‚Äôt do shit and that I need to learn how to do things but in fact I know how to do more things than she can. And the only thing she has over my head is that she can legally drive and I can‚Äôt. She doesn‚Äôt know how to pump her own gas, never had a real job before I gave her her first one and even then she came for me like she was my boss when I worked there before she did! She sometimes treats me like I‚Äôm a little kid not knowing how to do shit on my own. Like sure I can‚Äôt fucking drive but I know how to use the fucking bus, I have my own debit card and get jobs so I don‚Äôt use my parents money all the time (I still rely on them in between jobs but not as much as her), I can switch from my customer service persona to my casual everyday self, I don‚Äôt cry when customers yell at me, lmao I know how to pump my own gas, and a ton of other things like WHY does she treat me like I am below her?! 

There was a ton of other stuff I had to rant about but I gave myself some time to cool down from her making me angry so I can‚Äôt remember what else i had to say but thank you for coming to my ted talk. 

I‚Äôm not trying to attack her in anyway but she just frustrated me to the point where I can‚Äôt stand it anymore. We are both legal adults and she acts like she‚Äôs all high and mighty over me and can‚Äôt even pump her own gas bc she makes her parents do it and yes I realize that‚Äôs just as shallow as her coming for me bc I can‚Äôt drive but!!!

"a friend of mine believes she's middle-class even though what she pays in school monthly is the salary of a middle-class family. In an argument if whether all people at school are high-middle class/high-class I mentioned that fact and she was offended by that somehow and she posted a wpp story (which was not directly addressed to me but it was obviously mocking me) saying ""imagine thinking that because you have privilege people around you also have the same privilege"" the greatest thing is that she has more privilege than me but ok",angry

You know what would make me happier? If people started helping me for a change. Because I‚Äôm tired of living in a shitty small town, still living with my parents, working a shitty job that takes pride in the fact that they let customers shit all over their employees. I‚Äôm tired of always having anxiety over everything. I‚Äôm tired of being depressed. I‚Äôm tired of wearing my heart on my sleeve for everyone to see and take advantage of. I‚Äôm tired of telling people about my feelings and getting shut out because of it. I‚Äôm tired of needing weed to fall asleep, or to manage my pain. I just want to be a normal fucking person. 
I want normal fucking friends who give as much as they take. I want a mom who doesn‚Äôt abuse me. I don‚Äôt want to have to say sorry for every single fucking thing I do. I want to be able to cry without getting punished. I want someone to recognize me as a human being.

"Context: a very expensive private school. The other day we were chatting and then someone says ""at least 90% of this school is rich"" (in reality the word used was like saying ""rich"" but in a more derogative way), and I reply ""everyone in this school is rich tho"", and then my friends start saying that they aren't rich. And to that they start shouting at me and answering very badly, and saying things like ""Do you even know what being rich actually is? It is going on vacation to Europe, buying expensive things, (insert more things), I CAN'T DO THAT!""  and of course I start getting nervous because they're responding in a very aggressive way so I say ""What I'm saying is that we can all afford to pay a certain amount of money, so that puts us in a social place that would be high class or middle-high class"". To that answer they get super offended somehow and they start telling me that their parents work a lot to get them into that school, and I answer that I know that, that I've never said that their parents were lazy or something like that. But they still insist that I don't know what being rich is, and out of the blue they say ""we are middle class"" and that's when I lost it, and I reply ""Do you even know what being middle class is? Do you know how much the salary of a middle class family is? (insert the number)"" and then one replies ""OH YOU WANNA KNOW THE SALARY OF MY FATHER? IT'S EXACTLY THAT, I CAN CALCULATE IT RIGHT NOW"" (which probably wasn't true because in this case the salary of a middle class family is actually more or less what we all were paying to be in that school). And then my friend says ""But why are you all offended? She's saying that we're rich because we all have a certain income, it's not bad being rich"" but they still won't calm down, and they start repeating that they're not rich, or saying things like ""Do you understand that next year I will have to leave this school because I can't pay it?!! Do you even understand that?!!"" and I reply ""I understand that, but I'm just saying that we all have some sort of income that is more or less what being rich in this country means"" and they get furious, one replies ""If we were rich we wouldn't be in this school, we would be in a school that would teach us how to administrate a company"" I didn't even answer to that because it was too ridiculous. Then my friend says ""Stop answering so badly to her"", I ask them too to do that but they still shout at them. The worst thing is that they didn't even let me finish my ideas, when I talked about the salary of a middle class family I asked ""Do you have a scholarship?"" to calculate more or less how much we were all paying, but immediately they answer ""It's not that we want a scholarship because of nothing!!"", and then I explain that it was just to calculate the monthly price of the school. Luckily a friend stopped the argument by saying that it was stupid to argue because we obviously had different opinions, but still I was amazed by the fact that some of my friends didn't even know how much money they actually had.


After that we didn't talk about it, and in class everything was fine again. But then (fast forward the day after) a friend posts in wpp ""y'know when you were in a fight with someone like three months ago yet somehow you're still mad at them but you can't say anything because if you do people will call u immature or whatev so from now on whoever treats me like garbage i want u to know i will do the right back at ya' think because you deserve it and u suck and please grow up once and for all"" and then ""also if i ignore u it's probably because i'm at u but don't confront me about it because i will deny everything and i won't hesitate bitcj"". Even though it says ""three months ago"" it's obvious that it was talking about me because my friend's group didn't have any fight or argument with her three months ago, the only one we had this year was this one I'm telling. I get super mad because I thought that the whole thing had just remained in the thing that we had separate opinions, it was stupid to argue (which I agreed) but then she posts this and I get super mad. I didn't answer because I didn't want to fight again, but I hated the whole actitude of posting that in wpp stories (which all her contacts can see) and didn't even bother to send me a private message, or by the fact of doing that, which is something that really hurts. I also didn't want to tell her that because she would've probably answered ""oh but it wasn't about you"" (again, it probably was about me because she doesn't have real life friends apart from school and the only person she argued with in school were some classmates and me, but we spend longer time together than with those classmates, she doesn't even talk with them). I also hated the fact that she said that I treated her like garbage when I actually didn't, I only raised my voice once, but I never insulted them or answered badly like they did. She many times answers badly, once in class we had to read a story but we had the listening file, so some wanted to play it, to what she answers ""Ok but I don't know about you but I can't afford doing a trip to England to practice my speaking, so we should do it here!!"" (this may not seem that aggressive, but she shouted that, so after she said that all the class was surprised and the teacher said ""It's ok if you want to read, but there's no reason to be violent"". I guess she was offended because I said we were rich but I don't even know why they were all so offended by that when it's not bad to be rich.

Your boss is a prick. I was waiting for karma to take care of him, and now his daughter is sick and his dog got sliced in half by a train.

But as soon as you got your first apprenticeship you turned into such a fucking snob, and completely unable to see that the studio you were working at treated you like fucking Cinderella.

You were GIVEN a job at the next tattoo shop because of connections, and you refuse to aknowlegde it. You think you got in there with TALENT? YOU ALWAYS DRAW THE SAME FUCKING SHIT. Additionally, every tattoo I've seen you do has uneven lines and heals horribly bumby and scarred.

You shit on those who have given you handouts and you tear down relationships you have no business sticking your nose into. I am DONE being your friend. Hope your career was worth it, because that's all you got now.

"Hi

&amp;#x200B;

This is a email to my colleagues at work. I'm a apprentiance in system engineering.

 

Recently, I unfortunately very often feel that I am not treated with respect, for which I have the following examples:

 

If there is a meeting in which things that concern me are discussed, I will be mercilessly excluded and I have to look for the information myself somewhere afterwards. However, if I ask for it, I will be shot down with ""Yes, you are only the intern, that's none of your business"".

If there is new software or techniques, all but me will be informed by the team and I will be left out again.

I always have to do the ""dirty work"" - for example I asked today who will stay at work until 5:30 (our policy says atleast one person must stay until 5:30 PM), the rest of the team told me that they were going to leave anyway leaving me behind AGAIN, although i stayed yesterday and the day before too.

 

I've been here for a year now and I can't claim to have learned any new experience. I still know as much as I did before this internship and now I have enough!

 

I am tired of being excluded everywhere and always!

I can take a lot, I have already taken a lot, but if things go on like this, this company will break me eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

I do work here that any primary school pupil can do, the learning effect is zero! I was trained to configure, to maintain servers etc.. But this year I haven't done anything like that at all.

Sure, I made mistakes too, but everyone does. Difference is if I make a mistake I will be severely punished for it, but if a colleague makes a mistake it will be overlooked with a laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I'm in training - but that doesn't mean to exclude myself everywhere.

I simply have the feeling that I'm constantly being left out and don't get the respect I deserve. 

I don't want to go on like this any longer, If there isn't going to change anything as soon as possible, I'm not interested in working in this company anymore!

I told them ""The information you gave out was confidential, which is illegal to do. You record the calls for cases like this. I'm not your boss, this is your job""

She was annoyed but I don't fucking care. What's with people and being so lazy? Making me feel bad like I'm forcing them to go through every single call when 1) they could easily ask for info to narrow it down and 2) ignoring the issue could get that employee in deep legal shit.

"I work with really rare neurodegenerative diseases. This may be insensitive to some but the healthiest patients I see have got Parkinson's or dementia. Most have things like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also called motor neurone disease or Lou Gehrig's), often combined with a dementia. 

Today, I saw a patient with two(!!) different neurological conditions that caused progressive paralysis PLUS a mild dementia. The lady was the sweetest person you could think of. Kind, generous, warm. And she‚Äòs freaking lonely at home. Wakes up, gets dressed, sits around to watch TV. One of her two sons visits her for 90min every two weeks, one never visits and rarely calls. She hasn‚Äòt seen her grandkids since April or so, never has visitors and just sits around lonely and sad all day. Twice a week someone from social services comes to help her bathe/shower. 

I am just raging at the fact that her two sons and their children seem to just forget about this old lady. At least one of the grandchildren is old enough to travel by himself, to at least say hello. By old enough I mean over 18, so a fully qualified adult in my country.

"Seriously, it‚Äôs wild. Based on the opinions of these people I have gathered the following info:

1.	Parents are the worst people on earth, have no right to know anything about your life or existence, and are almost always overly controlling fascists who should be removed entirely from their children‚Äôs lives with zero contact.
2.	Men are fucking garbage and should never question their beautiful queens that have so graciously decided to tolerate them and their gross manparts.
3.	All parents-in-law are also nightmare demons from hell who want nothing for you but the burning pain of failure.
4.	If your partner does anything even remotely bizarre they are cheating on you and your marriage is fucked harder than the star of a gangbang porn.
5.	This needs to be said again because it‚Äôs apparently incredibly important: your parents don‚Äôt love you and you should never speak to them EVER again especially if they have a disagreement about something incredibly minor or political. They are dumpster people who deserve to lose the love of their children.

It‚Äôs nothing but angry incels and furious teenagers spewing diatribe from the perspective of someone who has no idea how the world works and think everyone should just hold their hand and bring them chicken nuggies whenever they want. It‚Äôs insane.",angry

"This world has become nothing but a glorified circus. Serious problems like mental illness have been turned into nothing but a tool for people for their own personal gain. Anytime I see anything on the news about suicide, school shootings, and so on they always spin it into a political statement for their own benefit. How about we think of how that person was doing mentally and how we could have helped them instead of trying to benefit ourselves and make us appear better to the public? It baffles me the mentality a person would have to use mentally illness as a tool. I, like hopefully many people, have had enough of this and change needs to happen. If we as humans don't change something soon, this world will go further into hell than it already has.

"It's honestly terrible. The teacher doesn't communicate well with the students. She barely reminds us when the homework assignments are due. She only mentions it in the Google Classroom and not in actual class. In fact, she doesn't check our homework. What's the point of doing the work if she won't check it anyway? While I have no problem with the actual material, how I am taught the material really pisses me off. I know that the students have to do their part and study for the tests and do their homework, but I honestly feel helpless in that class. Last year, I was able to maintain an A and get a 5 on the APUSH exam because my teacher was awesome. He assigned homework assignments that he actually graded, made study guides to study for the unit tests, made us play fun review games, and just did everything he could to help us excel in that class and on the AP exam. I loved him. He was a literal god. Now in my AP Gov class, I honestly feel alone. There's no one to help me. No fun review games. No study guides. None of that. The teacher just teaches us the concepts and says ""There's a test"" with literally no help. I'm on my own. I like teachers who *actually do their job* and help their students excel in their class and not teachers who simply force students to figure things out entirely on their own.

You need to compete against 800 other students for a single seat in the universities during the entrance exams so the chances are pretty much slim to none unless you're lucky.

So you have to hear about it from your parents for the rest of your lives. It becomes much worse if one of your friends get into a public one but you don't. This shits fucking sucks.

But I'm just so troubled by his behaviour, I feel embarrassed by it. I feel like : My bf which I respect very much suddenly turned to be a dog in front of stranger females, and trying so hard to please them. I feel humiliated.

In my country, we call this kind of male lack of disciplines. (I mean you with your gf on a date, better behave, right? ) Nobody want to be with a male has no disciplines. However, I can't find a correct notion or translation in English.

I feel very upset when I see my bf turned to a dog pleasing some strangers, like it's ruined our dates all the time. I don't think he realize it's wrong to feel so excited about other girls while your gf is just besides you watching. And I really don't want to call him a dog, I cannot find better english words to express this situation. And I'm pretty angry :(",angry

"Ok so
Tomorrow's my birthday, which is epic because I get to go to my favorite Italian restaurant. Also, I bought cupcakes for my friends at school because I always want to include friends. Well, one of my friends is allergic to basically everything, I feel really bad for her since she has a really specific diet. This means she can't eat cupcakes, but I didn't want her to feel left out so I asked her what was her favorite snack. She said dried strawberries and bananas. So I went to like 2 stores and the first was out of both and the second only had bananas. So I bought a 5 dollar bag of banana chips that looked really good and I brought them home and put them in my cabinet.

Well my mom's old friend stopped by unannounced and since my mom and I are kind of pushovers when it comes to friends we just let her do whatever since that's the ONLY THING SHE FUCKING DOES WHENEVER SHE COMES AROUND, but then she starts eating the banana chips. My mom glares at me when she notices I'm mad and going to yell at her friend. Apparently because she's the guest she can help herself to whatever she damn well pleases and that includes food I specifically set aside to bring to school. She also had no right to take that and my other food, I paid for it myself, but nooooo, it's under my mom's roof and she can give it to her friends. Also, I told my mom why I was mad after the friend left and she said I can get more food for friends but I only go to school 2 days a week and tomorrow's my birthday so I wanted to bring food tomorrow and I'm mad

Said friend also started pushing her opinions on to me while she was eating my food and I almost cried because she made fun of me for dressing like a boy and trying to get me to out myself as trans [told her daughter and daughter got interrogated so she told her mom] but that has literally nothing to do with this situation so I'll shut up it just made me REALLY mad and want to cry

"TLDR This is a rant post. This is an angry political rant and I gotta get this shit out. There is hate in my heart and I GOTTA get it out. 


What people fail to realize is that Barrack Obama openly and flagrantly lied to foreign leaders.

He publicly misidentified foreign officials, their offices, and worse, he didn't even know what his own cabinet was responsible for.¬†


Instead of promoting public businesses, Mom &amp; Pop stores that rely on as much business as they can get, businesses that in turn pay the average citizen and help keep people like you and me happy with the type of paycheck we should get, he literally diverted government officials (both foreign &amp; domestic) and military personnel to his own businesses. We're not talking a pittance here, we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars over 4 years.


This is the office of the President of the United States of America. The President represents each and every American, and is not an office fit for a person without integrity.


I work an entry level position, and I'm expected to work with honesty, integrity, accountability, and to bust my ass every day to earn my keep for an at-will employer. If I don't do my job, I don't live up to my company's standards, my ass is grass. That is America, that is Capitalism, that is fair.


This guy has had LITERAL hundreds of golf trips, personally insulted American citizens, has self-inflicted trade deficit through moronic bad deals. Oh fuck, wait I meant Trump. Trump did that. All of that. Literally. Here are my non-biased sources because you're now going to demand them but you wouldn't have originally since I invoked ""Obama"" from the start. Also, sorry Obama you were my means to an end and I apologize. ** See bottom for sources.


And that folks is called accountability. You make a mistake? You own up your bad, you apologize, and guess what? Maybe you, I don't know, Google that shit in the future so you know the fuck you're talking about and don't:

A. come off like an asshole

B. further dig yourself into a hole of 0 self-respect


Also, I'd want to impeach the FUCK out of any SITTING President who tried to pull the above horseshit ALONE on the great country of USA. Obama, Clinton, Bush, IDGAF - you fuck with me? You fuck with my people? We bleed for this country. We die as minimum wage lower class peasants for this country. You can grow a fucking pair and play nice like a normal functioning adult. Don't like it? Go drink your sorrows away in a tavern - go support a local business.¬†

You Are Not My President.

""If I were in The White House, I don't think I'd ever see Turnberry [golf course] again - I just want to stay in The White House and work my ass off."" *thunderous applause*

See Trumpgolfcount.com


That is a flagrant lie, you couldn't even tell it without breaking your voice it was so horrible. The audio on that video LITERALLY has you cracking your voice as your conscious and subconscious struggle to grip with how flabbergasting this statement, you just barfed up, is, and how could anyone possibly believe this and oh wait, the crowd is going wild. What on EARTH is wrong with this? Are these people drunk? Are they being paid? The fuck?


Hang on. There's more.


""There won't be times to go on vacations-"" Right because we're going to have to work to fix everything you've done to destroy America, okay got it. Continue.

""There won't be time to go golfing all the time-"" Right again because you've fucked our economy into oblivion, understood from the previous statment, check.

""I'm not going to play much golf-"" Well I should hope not because we sure as hell can't. I mean, I'm a full time customer support representative and I only work 40+ hours a week, and my wife who is assistant store manager sure as shit can't because she works 40+ hours per week as well, sometimes 9 consecutive work days. In addition, our parents have to take turns watching our newborn son because we can't afford childcare with our mortgage, medical bills, and cost of living in the same town as our employers, but yes continue please.

""I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to go play golf.""


Why is this even a thing? Why do you keep saying this? Is this like, something you're trying to convince yourself about here? Because we don't give a shit - honestly if you say you're not going to do something, and you do it, it seems pretty fucked up. I mean, that's the exact opposite of what you say, and somehow we're supposed to be okay with this? I mean, if your speeches and platforms were, ""Hey I love to golf and that's probably something I'm going to do at some point, yeah I could see that,"" that's just being honest, I get that. That said, it's completely not what we're hearing here. This isn't some fucking joke conversation either, this is your ""Hey look at me I'm going to be different""-promise. You fucking joke. Absolute shit eating liar. It's like a 12 year old kid going to his mom and saying, ""Hey I was hoping to have Nintendo tonight just so I can look at it, I don't want to play it, I have so much homework and need my rest so I won't be able to play but just looking at it sitting there makes me comfortable.""


This one resource I'm looking at - IDK if it's legit but I have to say, if they're going this far, it probably is, it says 218 Golf Trips and COUNTING.


The cost estimate to the American Taxpayers? About $109 million dollars. Holy FUCK.

Where the fuck do you get off selling all of that shit up there, and then have the balls to drop a $110 million fucking dollar price tag? Go fuck yourself, sir. Just get the fuck out right now.


I went on a company trip AND FELT BAD that the company was paying for all of my meals, to the extent that I tried to eat as cheap as possible. Holy fuck. Totally understand that his trips probably include expenses like security and this and that but for real. The man says he's got ZERO TIME TO GOLF, AND FOR YEARS BEFORE THIS, HE FUCKING GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO SLAM PRESIDENT, bless his mother fucking heart, BARRACK OBAMA FOR GOLFING??? Pot calling kettle black much here? Mary Mother of Christ.


I'm just so tired of all this shit. And it's what he wants. He wants us not to care. Fuck that. I'm not done yet, this is just one thing. THAT'S JUST FUCKING GOLF FOLKS. STRAP IN CUZ WE'RE GOING FOR A RIDE.

"Apologizing for the long post in advance. It's just that there's so much I barely have anyone to talk about for months that it literally bottled up in my throat and I NEED. TO. GET. RID. OF. IT. 
Not sure if this really belongs here, but I feel like I have to get this anger off my chest, so why not share it with strangers on the internet.

I live in a two party house. My boyfriend and I live on the top floor, the bottom floor is inhabited by a family of three (a mother and two children, the dad works outside of town and only comes over every two weeks) which we NEVER had any arguments with until about last week.
I mean, it's not like there weren't any reasons for arguing. This family's a mess - they hoard tons of garbage in front of their door and in the yard which makes it look like we're living in the ghetto until you enter our apartment, block the whole fucking driveway AND the street because their garage is ALSO filled with trash and they pull into the parking space like morons so that there's one vehicle where there would be space for at least two; they have the police and/or bailiffs over every few weeks because the mom doesn't pay shit; I overheard each of them loudly telling their secrets (14 y/o daughter smokes weed behind mother's back, mother has been cheating on her husband for seven years now, etc.) to the whole fucking neighborhood. We already had problems with the city council because they're too dumb to separate their organic waste properly (this is taken very seriously in my country), now they decided to throw ALL of their trash (plastic, paper and organic waste) into the residual waste bin which makes it pretty much impossible for us to throw anything in ourselves, so the bags full of used cat litter are piling on our balcony because we only can throw away one or two per month.
The thing is - all the time (this has been going on for a few months now), we didn't say a single word. We kept fucking quiet for the peace of the neighborhood.

This has been a really long backstory, I know, but I needed to tell this so it would be more understandable why I'm so DAMN angry about the shit that has been going on the past week.
I know the mom's currently going through a hard time - the Neighbours Screaming Around In Their Backyard Show recently told us that they're deep into dept and cannot afford the rent anymore -, but I have no clue why she's suddenly super pissed at us and harasses us because of the dumbest things you can imagine, like leaving our lights on after 10pm because ""it bothers her"" (the funny part here is that you CAN'T SEE THAT FROM HER FUCKING APARMENT. The only way it could bother her would be if she slept in the goddamn hallway.) A few days ago, she came up to us and seriously complained about the cat litter ""taking too much space in the bin"" (see above) and insisted that we should give away at least one of our cats. We told her to just separate her fucking trash properly, but nah.
So, I really have no clue what's her problem with us at the moment, but I feel more and more uncomfortable with leaving or entering our house simply because there's a chance of meeting her in the hallway. I start to feel like, for whatever reason, she wants to get us out of the apartment (which is not going to happen because it's literally perfect for us).
But I still continued to swallow all that down for the last few days - until I wanted to do some grocery shopping yesterday and saw that THIS FUCKING BITCH REMOVED THE FUCKING VALVE FROM MY FUCKING BIKE'S FRONT TIRE. SERIOUSLY, HOW LITTLE SELF-CONTROL CAN A GROWN WOMAN HAVE, ARE WE IN 6TH GRADE OR WHAT. I USE THIS FUCKING BIKE TO GET TO WORK EVERYDAY. IF I DIDN'T COINCIDENTALLY DO SOME UNSCHEDULED SHOPPING YESTERDAY, I WOULDN'T HAVE USED IT THE WHOLE WEEKEND AND WOULD HAVE NOTICED IT AT 4AM, HALF AN HOUR BEFORE MY SHIFT STARTS. IF I NOTICE THAT CUNT EVER TOUCHING SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO ME AGAIN I'M GOING TO BREAK HER FUCKING JAW.

As I said, not sure if this is the right subreddit for this story and I'm pretty sure no one's gonna read the whole thing anyway, but it feels good to have this off my chest now. Thank you for your attention. Have a nice weekend.",angry
"I'm 17 male and I just started college. Before I came here I fell for a girl but was contemplating asking her out. I just found out one of my friends fucked her a few days ago and I don't know I feel. I don't know if I'm jealous or just angry that I didn't shoot my shot sooner. I wasted time because I have a long and painful history of being rejected. 

Looking back at those rejections I start to see why I have problems asking girls out. I'm introverted, not  very social, not the best looking and not the most fit guy. My sense of humor is pretty weird but I'm at least kind of funny. I like spending my Friday nights at home watching YouTube and scrolling through Reddit. I have problems opening up about shit because every single time i've done so it's been used used against me in public. So I don't think I would fair well in a relationship.

And even when I'm able to look past all of that the first thing my brain goes to is accidentally getting someone pregnant or finishing early or catching an STD.

"So I‚Äôm one of those people who is too introverted and too nice to tell someone to shut up when they are pissing me off. It‚Äôs a serious personal flaw I intend to fix because this last emotional vomit fest has been the last straw.

Every time I‚Äôm on a plane or stuck in a situation where I have to talk to someone or sit in silence, the other person for some reason will always chose to talk about their serious childhood traumas and use me a free therapist and suck the emotional life out of me. I hate it so much. I look like a nice person so I guess that gives them the idea that I‚Äôm the right kind of person to dump on.

For example: My bf has a co worker he thought would be a good friend for me. (We just moved to a new area and don‚Äôt have many local friends). He said she was funny and fun to be around. He asked if I wanted to meet her. So I said ok and met her at the mall.

Big. Fucking. Mistake.

She would not stop talking about her childhood trauma and all the worst things that could possibly happen to a person. How her mom sexually trafficked her out to male relatives how her sisters and female cousins ruined her wedding and so on and so on.

No joke, we walked around the mall for about 4 hours while she talked at me. We even got low key chased out of a jewelry shop because she made the other customers and the cashier uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt want to ask her to change the subject or talk about my own problems because they seemed so small compared to hers. And I hate that. I hate being around people with bigger problems because that makes me feel like I can‚Äôt talk about mine, cause well, their shit is obviously more important.

I‚Äôm never going to hang out with her again. Because she has no hobbies, doesn‚Äôt drink and has nothing else to talk about besides her job and her trauma. I‚Äôm not paid to be a therapist and I don‚Äôt get out just to be weighed down by someone else‚Äôs baggage that takes the conversation hostage and sucks the fun out of the outing.

"I had to bury my beloved cat of 8 years the other day. He was diagnosed with cancer last week and went downhill quickly. Cancer has practically wiped out my immediate family and now my cat in the span of just a few years. It makes me so angry to see people take their big families and support systems for granted. My support system is a mother who cries just about every other day because everyone in our family is dead. We now only have a few cousins who can‚Äôt even be bothered to check in on us. I avoid Facebook because all I see are their posts of their accomplishments and how ‚Äúblessed‚Äù they are. Glad you and all of your siblings, nieces, nephews, parents, and grandparents, and great grandparents are thriving while my mom and I are saddled with funeral and hospital expenses for my uncle who died earlier this year.

Recently his house was broken into and his things were stolen, but fortunately most of it was recovered by police. They notified us that the items needed to be picked up from the station by a certain date. My mom mentioned this to our cousin who has two brothers with trucks. The cousin‚Äôs response was: ‚ÄúWell, I know a guy you can hire to get the stuff‚Äù Yes, we have able bodied cousins with trucks who couldn‚Äôt care less about our predicament. We ended up contacting an old friend of my uncle‚Äôs who helped retrieve the items from the police station. I attempted to pay him for his work but he refused and told me ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what friends are for.‚Äù Yet, my own cousin basically told us to go hire some stranger.

"I am rage, I am hate, I am loath, I am pain and I am suffering. I am a lot of things but I am not brave and I am not strength. The world would rather see me for my weaknesses than for my strengths. But I am angry and I want to destroy. I want to end this rock, Grind it to dust between my fingers. Hold these insects and tell them they are worth nothing. Rule as a mad man - destination,  the abyss they have built within me.

For context: I used to live in a shitty house in a bad neighbourhood, I rented out a room and my sister did the same on a different floor of the same house. I was there because my parents wanted us to be close as we are foreigners in a completely different country. Understandable.

However the house was filthy. Cockroach infestation in the kitchen, bed bugs in the walls (they had infested my mattress before pest control cleaned it, but I would still see them around the house even if not in my room). drug addicts in the basement, all around disgusting housemates that couldn't keep things clean and sanitary. Also 1 hour and 30 mins from where I work (one way by bus), I loved my job and would often stay late work unpaid hours because I dreaded coming ""home"".

Repeatedly I told my mom I wanted to leave, only to be asked to stay. My dad had passed little more than an year ago and upsetting my widowed mom who lives miles from her kids was the last thing I wanted, so I'd oblige for her sake. She said to wait till your sister's married, it will be soon (this was in January 2019 and now it's sept yet still that's  soon) Inside I was depressed mostly. I wanted to move desperately not only because the house was shit but because I was playing appearances. I wasn't religious, hasn't been for a few years by then, my sister knew but chose to ignore it as if it was a bad dream when I told her. We argued a few times about it but it only ever ended with her covering her eyes saying she'd rather not have me in her life than deal with the fact that I am agnostic.

So I played the part. 

The writing is a bit of me fantasising my hate in action, ""would I do were I a god?"" I was frustrated with  my family, with my culture and with myself.  Upset my culture  would ""save face"" rather than care about an individual person's mental health and happiness. I was upset I wasn't strong enough to stand up for myself.

Last night I got pushed over my limit. I don't know how, I was playing a video game, somewhat competitive, shooter. I've been playing for a year and a half or so and I still see myself doing god awful. consistently awful. spend 2-3 hours doing nothing but getting shit on and losing. I've put time into trying to learn how to get better, following advice of friends who are good, aim training, watching pros, and I still suck. it's not just video games, it seems to be anything with some sort of learning curve. It got to the point where I got pushed over my limit, blood pressure exceeded where it should have, I got up, clenched my fists, almost blew my forehead vein out by pushing out but holding my breath (idk if I even described that right), and ended up punching my desk, and then my bed a few times, ending my rage with pulling my belt out and hitting my back with it (I swear typing this out makes it seem far weirder than it was). I don't get these angry/rage fits often. I have only had about 3 or 4 in the past 2 years, the previous times were from school work, same thing, trying to learn, spend a few hours doing something, but can't seem to get it right. After the rage fit I thought about how much of a failure I am and that no matter how long I practice, no matter how much attention I give something, I still can't get it right.  I don't like getting into that rage. I don't like what happens during that period of time. I don't like being that kind of person. It really hit me afterwards when my SO got up and was about to leave because I scared them. It's time to do something about it. not too long after, maybe 10, 20 minutes, it's like it didn't even happen (to me). SO still scared, still unsure of what's going on with me, but to me, it's like nothing happened. What the fuck is wrong with me? how the fuck do I prevent this from happening?

I hope I'm not the only who hates helping people with something and then the person you just helped said something like ""Yeah, thanks, but...""

I mean. Gosh, I just did you a favor with your ""thing"". It's not that I helped you in the wrong way, it's just you don't want help?

Before continuing I'll make an example. 

So I was chatting with my friend (a little underage than me, say 3 years.) and she comes with ""Yeah, I'd like to change my profile photo with this one"" 

And sends me a photo. 

""But I can't. The format of the photo is too small and it would be cutted out by WhatsApp.""

So, without telling her, I decided to cut that photo with some photo editor programs online, then shape it with the perfect size and sent her. 

And then she comes out with ""Oh. But I will use this one instead.""

And sent me another image, much worse than the original and blurry. 

But then she said ""Don't worry, I will search for the non-blurry one on the internet."" 

Which believe me. It wasn't that easy for that kind of image.

In the end, she got the image she wanted (WHICH WAS ALSO BLURRY AS WELL!) and put it as her profile photo. 

Now, I am just thinking. Why, why the hell would you prefer having that image as your profile photo when I sent you a image which is definitely better and also better looking than yours. 

And what I hate the most is that she even didn't say ""Thank You"" or anything, she just ""smiled"" and put her image without further ado. 

Yeah, this sucks.",angry
"Excuse my grammar it's 3am. 

I cant put in the words how important life is. I want to become a surgeon and go to medical school, so I take the idea of life very seriously. 

 I believe you can not be in the medical field if you cannot handle situations well, if your critical-thinking skills are terrible and if you can't handle gore very well. Oh and if you cannot control your emotions well.  

Of course there are some people that can handle any of those things and have terrible critical-thinking and make it. Some May not make it very far or choose a  Different field in medicine. Some do very well. 


 So before we get started I have known this person basically since the beginning of high school, I have had plenty of time to understand them and their behaviours. I have become familiar with who they are what they like, their bad  traits, and good traits.  

I also have training  In sociology and  in psychology. I love Analysing people, understanding people and helping people. I love the fact that I am basically like a book or an encyclopaedia and full of knowledge. I love to share things with people, oh and I love to do extensive research also.

I also have hospice care experience. And have started my pre med journey and almost have 3 degrees. 

My friend. Decided to transfer to a school where medicine isn't its strong suit.   She did not seem realise that the school she was already enrolled in and her current home state is amazing and known for their medical programs.

 She also seems to think that a biology degree will make things harder and that she doesn't need that extensive background,  She also wants to transfer to another state after her EMT certification to become a ver. I am trying to explain that she should also get an associates in biology the cut half the world down for vet school until better skill and knowledge for an EMT.  

 Her academic advisor also told her there becoming the he will make her more prepared in will help her when she chooses to get her degree in veterinary science. But we all know the animals in humans are not the same thing when it comes to medicine.

The thing is. She knows nothing about biology or chemistry or mathematics or Advanced cardiac life support etc etc. She can barely pass her basic English classes.. 

Plus if she fails at EMT or Vet school she could fall back on a bio degree and still work in a hospital or lab setting or with animals EITHER WAY.

She's terrible at math and struggles with communication. She screams if you scare her even just by walking up behind her. She can't catch anything to save her life!!!! She gets emotional, especially when she doesn't understand or something goes wrong. Easily fooled as well. 

Now don't get me wrong. I support her. I encourage her decisions but I try to warn her and let her know that being in the medical field isn't about easy money or fun. You hold someone elses life in your hands. You have to be able to handle peoples problems and be strong and hold your ground and know that your problems don't matter on the field. It's not the place to gossip or get distracted easily or be on your phone 24/7. It's not just something someone decides to do one day because they watched a TV show and thought it was a cool idea. Its serious and it angers me so much because she doesn't seem to understand that. 

 She also wants to hop around different States to go to different schools and it just seems risky. Why waste time and money on community college more than once and make the process longer than it needs to be.  She also had a hard time keeping up grades in the classes she took in our home town. She's wasting time without even noticing it. And shes refusing to even consider my advice and I'm a little offended. 

 She also started acting completely different and dismissive since she moved to this other state.

 Also what upsets me even more is that she is like a sponge, except not a knowledge sponge.... she tries to become  Like  Who-ever  She is around. She's easily impressed And absorbs things from other people's personalities easily.  I know that she really wants to become a Vet and all these other things she's trying to do are wasting her time or seem like decisions shes made too quickly. She doesn't put much thought into a lot of things..  but it's not my Decision to make it is all on her.  I am just trying to save her time and work in the long run and help her out. She's extremely dismissive to my advice. It's angering. Makes me so angry.",angry
"I'm British, have just watched the news and apparently holiday companies are putting British guests on the ground floor of hotels in Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza.

Why?

Because it seems we have by far the highest number of balcony deaths. Y'know, where kids have their first 2 beers, get pissed and either jump from or fall from the balcony.

It just makes us look like a nation of fucking idiots. If you can't take a beer then don't fucking drink it!",angry
"What the fuck is it with working in a deli in a  grocery store and everybody wanting fresh chicken? How does this bitch even know, as I had cooked the chicken no more than an hour earlier? I didn't even get the chance to serve her directly, but she has the audacity to call the deli back, and give me shit for my service. She got so upset over a fucking **mistake** that was completely salvageable that she was almost cursing. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Next time I'm gonna tell the manager!"" Then fucking do it. Don't threaten my job, just do something. But I'm pretty sure they have to know who exactly served you. The person who served you not only made a simple mistake, but she's new to the job. You wanna bitch to my co-worker, too?

&amp;#x200B;

""If you had just done what you  were asked to-"" ""Ok, well that was my co-worker who served you."" Not only that, but I did what you asked me too and more. I cooked an entire bag of chicken. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't care who it was that served me"" Well then I don't give a shit about your problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is your life this miserable? That you have to be a cunt to 2 lowly deli workers because your chicken isn't less than 5 minutes out of the fryer? And be willfully ignorant of the situation? You think we're paid enough to deal with your sorry ass? Please, tell the manager! I'll be happy to explain to them how spoiled you're being. About how I tried to explain to you that you could come in and get something for free or get a refund, and you continued to gripe at me and accuse me of not doing my job, until I had had enough of you and hung up. You wanna be my boss? You seem to act like you know your shit. Or do you wanna act like a little girl, and cry to management that you didn't get the exact pieces of chicken you wanted? Again, how the hell you can even tell that a piece of chicken that had been in the hot bar for maybe 30 minutes, give or take 15, tastes any different than chicken that came out just 5 minutes ago is beyond my knowledge. And that you can be so marginally upset about it and decide to take it out on the guy who merely cooked the shit, you must hate your life.

&amp;#x200B;

This town doesn't deserve my fucking service. I'll be quitting soon, thank god.",angry

I'm still not okay, so sorry for any mistakes

I was just scrolling down my fb feed when I suddenly came across a picture of a 2-month puppy who had his legs and ears cut off by some sick man that is still out there enjoying breath

I don't know, I just looked at the poor puppy's eyes and felt like I wanted to die

or kill the person who did that

I honestly had a breakdown and cried for two minutes straight before returning to my seat and try to relax

"Cast: me:me m:mom

Backstory: So I was on the computer when my mom got home from work. She walked into the kitchen and got angry. I didn't do the dishes yet so she looked at me with that 'i don't even know how I'm related to you I'm so angry' look. The following conversation ensued:

m: so we're just leaving the dishes in here now?

Me:(sits there awkwardly) I forgot, sorry (not even with the slightest hint of an attitude)

M: Just do the dishes (impatiently)

A few minutes later I sit next to her on the couch, still haven't done the dishes yet. I tell her I love her and that the pants I'm wearing are too big for me:
M: you're coming up with every f***ing excuse you can

Me: no I'm not

M: hurry up and get another pair

So i went downstairs and didn't find a pair of pants that fit so now I have to deal with it. All I could do is think to myself ""sorry I don't want my pants falling down while I do the dishes. Geez.""",angry

"English is my country's second language. 90% of the people around me do not speak English on a regular basis. No one in my family was primarily English speaking or foreign. Yet because of English cartoons and the internet I grew up speaking primarily English and always had trouble speaking in my native language. I'm the definition of a receptive bilingual. I can understand the language, write it quite well, but I stutter my way through barely speaking it. Over the years people made fun of me for it, and it's actually hindered me in my career options and relationships.

"Okay. I feel like I should be angry. But I'm not
Situation: I'm a senior in high school, and last week I was cut from my highschool soccer program. Seniors are not allowed to play Junior Varsity soccer, so I was cut. But here's the thing: I didn't deserve it. No, that's not my selfish brain. Legit. I didn't deserve it.
A few of the kids who made Varsity are not better than me. Not my words, but other players and some parents of players (parents of kids ON VARSITY) and my family. A lot of people aren't happy with my coach for the decision, but I don't feel anything.
I do admit that at first, I was very sad and cried on one or two occasions. But I never got angry. Other people are, but not me and I cannot understand why. And it bugs me. After I was told the news face to face by my coach, I felt sad and a little bit understanding (if you can get what I mean). The only bad things I say about my coach's decision are words that other people put in my mouth. So here's the question:

Should I be mad about being unjustly cut?",angry
"Before we begin, I don‚Äôt expect you to read. Also you most probably won‚Äôt care. Just had to archive my feelings
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Yes, this is me being jealous. I am very jealous of my sister. I don‚Äôt understand why she got so lucky. I wish I got as lucky as she did. I also wish I didn‚Äôt screw my life up like I did. 

Yesterday and today, I noticed how she succeeds at a lot of stuff I often fail at. Yesterday, I was at an exchange student camp out thing. All these kids from different countries came to our state on a trip. Well, my sister (10) casually went over there and began conversation. Boom everyone tried talking to her on the hay-ride thingy.  How did she do that? She gave me the ‚Äújust talk to people and be friendly‚Äù answer. That doesn‚Äôt work for me. So I tried to initiate conversation with one and, nothing. I felt so ignored and failed. How in the world did she just get the entire exchange student body to know her instantly?

Today when we went there to pack up and take my exchange sister (from Japan) home she literally was walking by, and all the exchange students screamed ‚ÄúCome here, come here‚Äù and she got to be in the picture. Excuse me wtf, where is she getting all this success? I don‚Äôt understand it. 

This problem doesn‚Äôt only count this! In school I can barely get friends. It‚Äôs so hard to pick them up and take them home. Its too hard. Meanwhile, my sister has like 8 confirmed friends and is constantly going to friends houses and sleepovers. What the hell am I doing wrong? I‚Äôm doing everything she is doing!  

The problem that I have is that many of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù I have are not friends. They‚Äôre just people that are accessories to my life. A large majority of said accessories, are female. The gender isn‚Äôt the problem. It‚Äôs that I can‚Äôt have them spend the night, for obvious reasons. I want more male friends so that way I can have a huge sleepover, just like how my sister is doing. 

Am I jealous? Yes I am entirely jealous! What am I doing wrong? somebody just please make me equal. This is such an injustice",angry

"This happened a few years ago and my dad is ok now. 
(Insert obligatory mobile rant here)
I don't remember much of the situation but this is what I do remember:

My dad had heart surgery and was doing very well. My family and I went to visit him as often as we could. We always had fun during our visit a even though my dad couldn't leave the bed.

We had great conversations. We even giggled a bit when we could hear my dad's roommate (he had a shared room) snoring. On this day, my dad was set to be discharged.

The nurse came in and had a smile on her face. She asked my dad how he was feeling. He said he was great. The nurse checked my dad's vitals and they were normal. Then, she said it.

She said we had to WAIT EVEN LONGER for my dad to be discharged. All I can remember after that is tearing up in pure anger and clenching my fists. I also remember the thought of throwing the nurse out the window (I was REALLY mad)! I looked at my family and we had to leave.

We waited a few months and he was discharged. I still hold the grudge against the nurse to this day. I know it's petty but I don't care. I waited to see my dad at home for MONTHS and we had to wait again. I was heartbroken and infuriated. I'm angry typing this!

Like I stated earlier, my dad is ok now and I couldn't be more thankful for that.",angry

"About 2 yeas ago began working at a company that started out at almost double the minimum wage. This company does not discriminate based on age, education, or experience. Many people get hired in as their first job. Personally when I had to get my first job the only places available for me started out at minimum. It took many years job jumping before I came across this one. Every other job I worked at started at minimum or just above it with ‚Äúraise‚Äù opportunities of 25 cents. No matter how hard I worked I could never break through to a decent pay for cost of living. Then I found this job. Starting pay was amazing, raises were based off of sales numbers, requirements of the job were easy once you had a routine and it worked for me. Within a year of working there I had already bumped my hourly rate up by $4. My determination to do my job well and consistently was finally moving me up in life. The harder I worked the higher my pay but the expectations put on me were also higher. This was okay though, I knew how much I could handle and where I needed to stay steady in order to be where I wanted financially.....Then I took a manager position. I needed the work experience and with all of these opportunities I was SOOO excited to be working with a team. My goal was to motivate and help my associates move up in this company like I was able to. I HAVE NEVER MET SUCH ENTITLED BRATS IN MY LIFE!!!! All they want to do is stand at a register and wait for customers to come to them. They constantly complain how their sales standard is too high and the company is screwing them. They refuse to do the manual floor work required for their positions such as cleaning, organizing and putting out stock. Everyday I hear the same thing, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no customers‚Äù. It is always the same variation of complaining. Yet there are customers! This is not a cashier job this is a salesperson job!! The customers are walking around aimlessly not a word being spoken to them. This is not the only entitled attitude they have towards work, they feel as though the schedule needs to be made around their needs. Yes I will do my best especially if given advance notice but in the end this is still a job and they are hired in order to be here. THIS IS A JOB. Why does it seem like no one can comprehend that a job is a place for work. It is not a side thing you do in your free time it is not a social gathering to chat with your friends. I am so blown away by this warped view of of how they should be ‚Äútreated‚Äù and their entitled attitude about what they deserve. I have been in their shoes, I know exactly how difficult this job is. Everything they are complaining about is the work required of them to get raises. Do they really expect raises from doing next to nothing?  Can someone please try and explain this for me?",angry
"We were visiting a tourist site (a cathedral) and I was wearing a long skirt and tank, low cut but not so much that I had cleavage or anything. I told my friend yeah maybe I should change? Just asking her opinion because I was 50/50 about changing. She makes a totally uncalled for comment: ""Yeah you look like a streetwalker."" I was shocked. 
And to make it worse, she started aughing hysterically like it was a a creepy evil laugh I never heard before.. it was definitely not a friendly ribbing comment. And when I repmied ""omg what I'm pissed now"", she kept laughing... I didn't know how to react and I don't know if she noticed it or not but I went to the bathroom right after to calm myself and was pissy for an hour afterwards. I felt like crying honestly. I felt self-conscious and ugly the rest of the day.

No dynamics or anything. Everyone just plays with their phone themselves, no family warmth or anything. Gosipping other bad people life.

And now even I finally always get good grades on college you never give any appreciation.

Just consume news everyday. Increase your stress with trash irrelevant politics news and don't give a fuck for your family health.
Never admit your mistakes. Just never say sorry forever.

Spread your stress to your family, always trash talks society to your children and disregard the positive ones, then cover it with ""parents advice"" to make excuse for your toxicity.

Yes. I'm now 22yo (male). But I can't seem to have safe place to rant for a very long time.
There's no safe friend to talk my deepest feelings.
No one seems to take a hint what I'm feeling.

I can't seem to confront my parents seriously yet. Because my parents never make the family environment safe place to open up. They always criticize first, advice first. Never acknowledging my feelings. They even never truly open up their past.
When my parents start to shout, I feel overly reactive to what they saying and can't seem to respond clearly.

There are still may things to blurt. But I can't think more at moment.
That's for now.

"I'm in a job right now on contract. Essentially I have to make good in this gig for a year to make it permanent. You do 12 hour shifts, 84 hours in a 2 week period.

I won't bore you with too many details, the point is I'm going from nights (just got home) to days on Wednesday. It's a shit turnover since you lose most of the first day of your weekend to sleep.

Shift starts at 5:30. I show up every day at 4:30, hang with the guys, do a little socializing and head in to work. I'm always relieving the dude on the opposite shift at 5:15. He gets out a bit early and usually returns the favor.

Problem is that when I'm not coming in the next day, half the time I'm being relieved by the shift that works the opposite schedule. This dude relieved me at 6. I'm livid.

"My year ten formal has a social media and they put a survey out. The formal is organised by the students so you can imagine how awful it will be. Basically there were questions listed like ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs the biggest bitch?‚Äù, ‚ÄúBiggest cakeface‚ÄùMost likely to get surgery‚Äù... yeah. 

The popular clique runs the page, so of course it‚Äôs more of a popularity contest thing with some positive questions like ‚Äúhottest girl‚Äù and ‚Äúhottest guy‚Äù. Which are such stupid awards to give by the way. 

Felt like venting; you can‚Äôt argue with dumb people at all. I messaged them privately to reconsider this awards idea. But they basically, as kindly as they could but it came across very passive aggressively, that majority of the people are in on the ‚Äòjoke‚Äô and it‚Äôs for fun.. 

Well my school doesn‚Äôt have the best reputation - there‚Äôs troublesome and mean people here. Plus the majority that are in on the joke are the popular clique... 

I can‚Äôt tell if they genuinely think it‚Äôs just harmless fun and people who are offended just shouldn‚Äôt quote ‚Äúparticipate and ruin the fun for everyone else‚Äù, or they do know it‚Äôs wrong but they‚Äôre trying to justify it. Because how are nominations for such embarrassing things like ‚Äúwho‚Äôs most likely to die a virgin‚Äù not awful? I think it‚Äôs the former because the popular peers don‚Äôt outright bully anyone. Not from what I‚Äôve seen anyway.

Thankfully enough people complained so they removed some of those offensive questions, like ‚Äúmost likely to die a virgin‚Äù, but they kept biggest rack, biggest ass.. They told me they message the person beforehand they were nominated for an award to see if they would be comfortable to receive it that night. But I still strongly think it‚Äôs messed up to even have this awards poll in the first place. Imagine being nominated for something humiliating and sexist.

I also forgot to mention the poll is completely anonymous.. so you can imagine how ruthless people can be.

I don‚Äôt think I want to attend this formal at the end of the year, even though I already paid. But it could be a fun time with my friends.",angry
"So I was on r/anime scrolling through some anime posts (what else?) and I came across a Fullmetal Alchemist gif of part of the last episode with Alphonse &gt;!finally back with his body!&lt;, I was a bit peeved at first but it was obvious from the beginning &gt;!he was going to get his body back!&lt; anyway so I let it slide, then I looked at the comments and someone was pissed about the ‚Äúspoiler‚Äù and then a huge d*ck hole came and said 

‚ÄúDude it‚Äôs a decade old anime, get the f*ck over it, if you‚Äôre that sensitive about spoilers, did you know &gt;!Tony dies!&lt; in Endgame? Crucify me b*tch‚Äù

I know it‚Äôs been a while since Endgame was released and all but still just coming in and blurting out something some people still care about? F*cking come on!",angry
"Casually walking in my room to see this 5 yo playing at my laptop without my knowledge. Asked my mom about it(in a different room) and my sister who was in the same room said that she allowed him. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO NOR ANYONE IN THIS WORLD to TOUCH my stuff that I REALLY care about deeply. And she still has the nerve to say that I am as immature as always. She was the reason in my childhood I had a password on my laptop because she would simply take it without telling/asking me. I can't just talk with her about it because she is so immature I can't find common ground. She simply thinks she deserves everything for the nothing she made in this family. Oh no. She did something. She did put my mother in depression and ""ran"" from home several times with the car she didn't paid for...getting off topic. Right now my blood is boiling.  I know if I start talking to her she would simply say anything so it sounds like I'm the asshole.",angry

"This has been a burning question that I had for the longest time and I keep asking myself this question.

So there was this girl that I dated towards the beginning of last summer. Everything was great, and I thought that we were going to be together for a good while. A month passes after we started dating and she tells me that she slept with her ex. Yes, I clearly realize that I was the rebound guy, seeing as she dated him a good 3 or 4 weeks before she and I did and consciously went to his house ""for closure"" despite me telling her not to. But whatever, we broke up the day she confessed,  I moved on, and am currently looking.

The reason why I bring all of this up is that later on that summer, she gets back together with the guy. I talk to her every once in awhile, and earlier this year, she was telling me that ""he's changed"" and that ""he's a better person now"". Bullshit. I've known her long enough to understand that she makes very poor life choices that not only affects herself, but everyone else as well.

I can't seem to wrap my head around why she would be willing to get back into a relationship with that asshole. I've met the guy before and my friends have, too. I can vouch for how terrible he is first-hand. She somehow convinced one of my friends that I'm not too close with that ""he's not all that bad"", but I know I can't say the same. He took my girl, for fuck's sake!

I had to release some steam after some recent events. Thanks for reading. I really appreciate it.",angry
"Does anyone else hate that colleges/universities support positions that do not have to follow labor laws. As a joke I was introduced as a slave one day to a patient. Working for negative money because of tuition it is not completely wrong, but its definately not funny. 

The educational system is broken in so many ways. Let's discuss. 

My main complaint so far:
I asked my 12 month placement if I could have two days off to support my significant other's (SO) decision in donating his bone marrow to help someone else's health (a stranger). I requested the days off to be labeled as a ""medical emergency"" so that it won't count towards the 15 PTO I have, but dont forget I dont get paid $$ I get paid in experience. They said no! 

The association that finds donors will accommodate the person donating themselves and their ""caretaker"" as long as they get an itemized bill that includes the necessary spendings to get the donor where they need to be. These include work days they wouldn't have missed if not for the procedure. My SO has no problems sending in a pay stub, so the company knows what he typically makes. 

I do not get paid, but my placement (at a hospital) will not support a process that can save life's. I want to support my SO and a process that can save lives and all I want in return is two days that are not counted toward my PTO, so that I can use my PTO to go to the annual conferece for continuing education. I am the only person that can travel with my SO for the procedure as we live very far from our good friends and family. And my placement knows this.

I plan on using my PTO to go home (10 hr drive away) for Christmas and Thanksgiving, plus a Baptism (I am the godparent), a conference for continuing education, and graduation (I am required to go to). Having to use my PTO for the hospital trip to support my SO's decision in being a donor leaves me one day left that can be used for a sick day and ZERO for job interviews as I am graduating in May 2020. 

FML. Two days off a 12 month placement is NOT going to affect my education!!!!!",angry

Most of us are around the age of 18-23 but recently, there have joined lots of ""kids"" around the ages of 12-15. We have ranks, from Newbie to Veterans and Generals. I am a Veteran (it means I have been in this group for over 3 years). Nothing bad so far. So... This has happened last week, after one of our representations pretty far from home (we were staying at some school dorms). I was there with my girlfriend as well, her having almost 3 years in as well. There were a few other veterans and about 11 newbies. One night, after the show, while we were at the dorms, we (the veterans) were casually drinking, while still trying to teach the newbies important stuff. After a few hours, my girlfriend felt sick and we rushed to the bathroom (yeah, too much beer). This was at about 3am, so more than half of the people were asleep. One more guy came to see if everything's alright and stayed with us until my gf felt better (thanks T, I know you're reading this). After about an hour, we went to sleep. The next morning, a few of us, veterans, left early to get to work or other stuff, even though there was one more day of representations. So after a day, when everyone was at their homes, I get a message from a friend that I trust that made me so angry I wanted to beat the person who started this. Someone has said that while in the bathroom, my gf gave bj's for free. I was vivid. I've talked with everybody who knew about this and everyone mentioned the same guy as their ""informer"" even though, this evening (it's 23:35 rn) I've went to talk to that guy FACE TO FAVE and he said he knew nothing. There's just too much evidence pointing to him starting this. Now, I wouldn't have a problem, I would just not give them attention. But my gf has a pretty bad past especially about sexual actions (long story short, she was raped when she was younger). I can not let that a**hole make stories about her especially around this subject. I would beat him until he can't get up if I saw his face again.",angry
"I'm so fucking angry about all these petty arguments about why we shouldn't bother doing anything. I'm a ""libtard"" I guess according to the assholes on fb. I don't want to take away the guns. I just want SOMETHING.... ANYTHING... to be done about this. Im tired of being told laws won't work and I'm tired of people just straight up not caring about our fellow humans' lives. Don't you want to stop seeing dead people on the news every other day??? Why can't we at least agree on the simplest thing that people are dying and that efforts should be made to stop them from being killed!?!!!",angry
"But when my dad uses my childhood to build up a skill for the sole purpose of playing for the church, you're literally taking the only good thing my early childhood had to offer and say that I don't truly own it. I'd be chastised for not practicing (using a fucking belt!) while I tried to enjoy it on my own. I'd even make my own songs and to this day, he thinks I'm doing nothing.  I want to enjoy myself playing the piano. That's the point of a hobby. And he has the nerve to say I don't care about the piano. 

It angers me when I tell someone I don't want to play for the church and they say, ""but why not""?  I really want enjoy my talent but this pressure to share it with everyone is just ridiculous! Why can't I play in peace and just show my close friends? Is it a bother that I have to continuously carter to your self grandeur, dad? If you just wanted a better son, why didn't you just adopt one, you selfish prick! 

He even says if I play for the church, I'll give you a car. Some parent you are, Dad! Even if it's the only thing you want from me, I won't give it to you. You won't accept me, even now as I want to keep making music for my own enjoyment. It's not even about the piano anymore. It's about keeping me in line for your trivial shows of a good life, one youre certain won't exist as long as you are you.",angry
"As of late the only emotion I can feel is angry/frustration. I think it's mostly because of my job. I'm work on getting out but my situation is complicated. I work 24/7 cause I live at work. Its gotten worse lately. I'm either angry, frustrated or feel nothing. I need help. Is there a way, even if its medical, to become emotionally dead. If angry is all I feel then I dont want to feel anymore. I cant find happiness in anything now. If I'm going to survive until I can save enough money to move I need to be rid of all emotion. Please help me before I end up risking everything.",angry
"I know, just right now I thought my mom bumped into me on the stairs on purpose, so I calmly ask, ‚Äúwhy‚Äôd you push into me?‚Äù Because I was irritated from Her and and her shit show of a fucking husband fighting all the time. 

Bumping into me was something they would do to start shit.

Then she starts fucking screaming, yelling at the top of her fucking lungs dude. ‚ÄúI DID NOT!!‚Äù ‚ÄúWHY ARE YOU TRYNA BLAME ME!!?!!‚Äù

Throwing a tantrum like a little 3 year old.

That‚Äôs literally what my parents do. I hate them for it.

"I went in for tooth pain and got told it‚Äôs my fault because I don‚Äôt floss or brush my teeth everyday. Was told all this in a stupid annoying patronizing tone. And when I explained that I do floss with no bleeding and brush well, was told that I was wrong because I bled when they flossed my teeth. Like what the hell?? And despite being 22 years old, the doctor then proceeded to tell my mom that my problem was that I need to floss and brush more. Lady, why didn‚Äôt you tell me???? And yet they never had an answer as to why that tooth pain is making my whole cheek hurt and render me unable to chew properly and why my whole lower jaw hurts. Then proceeded to tell me that I need to shell out 200 for a thorough cleaning.

Screw them. I‚Äôm switching.",angry

I want to break shit and wild out but I can‚Äôt and that makes me angrier I have my ways of getting out my anger but it only works for a little while. Almost every night I get these waves of anger. I know I probably just sound like an edgy ass person but I just needed somewhere to talk about this.

"side account for obvious reasons.

but I‚Äôm literally tired of living life like this. I‚Äôm so angry with how my cards are playing out. My schizophrenic and bipolar mom is having a horrible episode rn and I‚Äôm alone with my dog because he‚Äôs the only person who‚Äôs actually here and supports and protects me.

my older sister left as soon as things got bad and she‚Äôs not coming home tonight. my oldest sister is fighting with my mom because she can never control herself and always goes to violence. my dad isn‚Äôt home yet and if he was he‚Äôd do nothing because he enables my mom‚Äôs behavior. my neighbors don‚Äôt want anything to deal with my mom or my family anymore.

I hate my family, I hate how they always leave me to handle my mom, and I hate how they expect me to be okay with it. I‚Äôm fucking traumatized in this house and I am so happy to be moving out back on campus soon for college this month. I‚Äôm not coming back, I refuse to live this again. I‚Äôm fucking angry with this life.

I hate this. I hate having to parent my parent. I hate constantly being neglected. I hate how my pup is my best friend, the one who stays in my room or guards my door whenever things get bad, because he‚Äôs 12 and I know he‚Äôs not going to live forever. 

I hate the people who complain about such simple things in life. The ones who take things for granted. I‚Äôd fucking kill just to not worry about what‚Äôs going to happen at home. To not be severely stressed like this. To not have my heart used and abused whenever I reach out. I‚Äôm tired of this.

I‚Äôm just so angry I really want to give up. I don‚Äôt know what else to do anymore. the police stopped caring atp and my mom always manages to get out of the hospital because of my dad. Fuck this family.

I fucking hate everything and fuck God for leaving me unanswered for years. I don‚Äôt have faith in anything anymore because I always get fucking hurt and slapped in the face. Fuck everything I hate this shit.",angry

"I started going to the gym like a month ago and there are always people who get into the gym, walk on a treadmill for like 10 minutes, or lift like 5-10 kilograms on all machines.

Plus if you are lifting 10 kilos, why do you just do it for like 5-10 minutes and go home. I can assure you that you can do shit like that on the streets, or at your home. You are wasting your money and it's so frustrating. If you go to the gym your goal is to get healthier, get in shape, then why do you take the time of your day to go to the gym, be there for 10 minutes and go home. I am 15 fucking years old and I can do at least 35-40 kilos. I don't know why is this so frustrating, they are just minding their own business and doing their thing, but it just doesn't make sense at all and I need to get this out there.",angry

"Not a lot to say, just a small story about a friend's recent incident. Not friend's anymore. 

My friends cat had recently given birth to 4 kittens, all gorgeous little jellybeans. However, this friend's house was filthy. Boxes and shit piled to the ceiling, cat crap everywhere. Not a good environment for them.

One day, I see a post on r/deadpets on the death of a kitten. I'm shocked to see my friends tag on the post. One of the kittens had died. A box from his shithole house had fallen on it, and crushed it. He used r/deadpets to lie to the people of Reddit. He pretends as if it was unpreventable, but he knows it was.

The other 3 are alive and well, and are growing happily in their filthy home. This friend is an idiot, as he STILL hasn't cleaned his house after the death of this kitten. He hasn't learned his lesson.",angry

"Decided to go a little more in depth with why I'm so angry.

A year ago, two days before my 17th birthday, my mom kicked me out. This was about six months after I attempted to OD and a lifetime of physical abuse from dear mommy.  

Why put my though the broken bones, the strangling, drowning, and mental jumbling for nothing? She was a teen Mom, depressed, alone. I get WHY she did it, just I get to live with the damn pain from it. 


I remember virtually none of my childhood. Not even the good stuff. The only reason I know I was injured is because I remember her telling me about it, and hiding under my bed because it was the only place I was safe. I could defend myself without her pulling me back out. 

Now she expects me to go live with her! Ha!!

My grandmother, whom tormented my mother in her youth took me in once I was kicked out. What happened in the sixish months I was there isn't really important. Just a lot of fighting. 

About four months ago granny kicked me out as well. I had to relocate my dog and move in with my boyfriend and his family. 

Now my gradpa doesn't talk to me, nor do my aunt and uncle whom practically raised me. 

When I turn 18 I want to cut off contact with my small family. I shouldn't have to! They should love me, want me to thrive, support me. Instead they shut me down. 

Because of all of this I was forced to drop out of my senior year of high school and work full time. My friends stopped talking to me. 

Just why...?",angry

Another car could still park to our right button it would be tight. The spot to our right was empty and there was plenty of other open spots. We go in shopping and when we come back someone has parked next to us. It is an old man that happens to be leaving when we are. He assumes that I parked since I'm the guy and starts to complain about the parking. Trying to tell me I should come and look how tight it is.

Why did you park there you senile old fuck? You chose that spot even though you didn't have to. There are handicap spots if you can't walk and if that's not a problem then chose another parking spot.

"I happen to be going through a rough patch - I'm pretty blunt about it, I'm bipolar (amongst other things), I have a history of really low moments and for some reason it has come back heavily at the moment. It comes from my mother's side and after a pretty rough phone conversation with her where she was very clearly able to sense that things are going wrong (she feels guilty about passing it on to me and my dad feels helpless because he has no idea what it's like), I ran to the store to grab whatever crappy, ""I remembered to eat today,"" microwavable food + beer I could. Almost the moment I walked in, some super poppy upbeat song came on and I just wanted to drown babies having it blaring at me. It was so fucking obnoxious. I did a soundhound search on it so I could properly complain about how much I fucking hate it later, it was, [""I don't wanna be sad,"" by Simple Plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OttPq7ceH9E). Don't click it if you don't want an earworm that will be a cheese grater to your ear drums and brain.

The song couldn't sound any fucking happier and it's like it's bragging about, ""lol, I haven't gone out in the sun in, like, so long,"" and, ""I've seen doctors and taken pills and stuff, lel."" Get fucked. I hate them fucking turning mental illness into happy fun times soulless trash music. There's no fucking soul in this bullshit, really, fuck you. I wish they could actually feel what depression felt like for a day, it's not just being ""sad."" It actually has very little to do with sadness, which just shows how out of fucking touch they are about the subject. It was obviously written by some neurotypical cunt that things the kids love songs about being angsty and sad and has never been so depressed that they stopped functioning.

If you're in that band and you found this googling your own name, fuck you. Your band is shit, really, the music is unlistenable bullshit. I'm glad the trend died where people actually went to your shows. I hope you have to work at the store where your song played bagging groceries so you can suffer having to listen to it.",angry
"Let‚Äôs tell a story. I met a girl, we became friends in school like first day we met in 8th grade. 
We became best friends. Every time when she‚Äôs sad she calls me and she says that I‚Äôm a hero and that I‚Äôve saved her life (which I did actually.) She always calls me we always meet each other. Every time when we separate she says ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù I say ‚ÄúLove you too.‚Äù 

We are close and I mean we really are close. She says I‚Äôm a nice guy and I‚Äôm always there for me. I‚Äôm not like every other guys that just care about themselves, these fuckboys. I really care about her and I love her. 

Then a month ago after a year of knowing her I all of a sudden got feelings for her. We met even more, she called me even more, we talked about everything and did everything. It was us. Like one day we were on a restaurant with our friends and all of a suddden we held each other hands. I was home at her place sitting in her bed and all of a sudden she laid her head at my shoulder. We were closer and better friends than ever. I figured that we had something. Everyone thought so. My friends, her friends, my brothers even my teacher said so lol. 

So I sat down with her and tried to kiss her. She pulled her head away and she like walked away. Later she called me. She said: 
    ‚ÄúI just ended my relationship with my ex and I am not ready to start all over again.‚Äù 
I figured that being the worst apology ever. I mean we really loved each other. And the very next day she starts meeting up with the schools hottest guy, have sex and gets screwed over. This guy was a fucking maniac, he bullied small kids and was in a fight almost every day. He was mean, he had nothing except the look. And I am just thinking every day. What did that guy have that I didn‚Äôt. Our relationship was stronger than theirs. What attracted her so much, what made her fall for that mean bully and drug dealer. Now I know it was the look. He looked good. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm looking good I‚Äôm pretty slim. That‚Äôs probably why, he had nothing else.
A week after she does the same again fucks this other guy and gets screwed over. Why does she keep falling for players just because they look good. And one day she said to her friends: 
‚ÄúSome day I hope I can find someone that truly loves me for who I am.‚Äù 
I got so mad that I went straight into the woods, screamed and punched against a tree. I mean ‚Äúwhat about me.‚Äù I love you for who you are and you know it. I did nothing wrong everything was going the right way we even had the close body contact - and the fuck? We had something. I was always there for her what wasn‚Äôt there to love? Why couldn‚Äôt I get her. 


Because I am not sexy and hot like these other guys. And when I say we are close I mean close. She said it herself that she‚Äôs never been so open to anyone but me. So what‚Äôs the fucking problem? I mean we had something everyone saw it. I did nothing wrong? And then these bullies gets an easy ride just because they look good. That‚Äôs the problem in our society.

The kind and nice but slim guys gets ignored. 
While the mean but good looking guys that doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the girls and just wanna have sex gets an easy ride. Love doesn‚Äôt mean anything these days. I live in a very small town everyone knows everyone and when I say that I‚Äôm referring to this town. There‚Äôs is no such thing as love here. This thing has happened twice to me. 
I am doing nothing wrong! I just doesn‚Äôt look very good. I am not ugly. Most girls falls for my eyes, my smile and things but the Baywatch guts with great dick, whoa let‚Äôs get em. I mean do girls even care about personality. My personality is the strongest thing about me. Damn! I know this text got messy but I‚Äôm so angry.

" 

You know I‚Äôm actually pretty smart? As in book smart, keeping a 4.0 GPA was a breeze for me, classes weren‚Äôt too much of a challenge and math is one of my strong suits. You know I didn‚Äôt know that until the seventh grade? When I took some kind of stupid test and somehow managed to get into an advanced class despite the fact that I never learned how to divide by decimals. I couldn‚Äôt handle it, it might sound stupid how it was just a middle school class, but I couldn‚Äôt. I went from being in the special group of kids who got handed easier worksheets then the others and trying to hide my own shame. To being told that I was in this class because math probably came easy to me. Remember how I said I still didn‚Äôt know how to divide by decimals? It‚Äôs because no one ever taught me, I was absent the day we learned long division and after that division just flew over my head. I was an idiot, people told me I was an idiot so that‚Äôs what I was. Other kids poked fun at me, one group of boys in particular. So I would lash out because I didn‚Äôt really have friends to defend me because they thought I was scary after I lashed out in class. My parents didn‚Äôt know where all of this anger was coming from, they tried their best, but I never told. But you, you had plenty of friends, you knew the entire grade even when we started high school you were almost never home. The few friends I managed to make ended up moving, so I was left scrambling to make friends with *somebody* and I did. I got some friends, not many but they were nice. You were fine of course, they were *your* friends too, all of them were. Now we‚Äôre on completely different social levels. You think it‚Äôs hilarious that I only have a small circle of friends, you poke fun at it. So I poke fun at your crappy grades because I‚Äôm an asshole and my grades are perfect. I make fun of the way you do things to, and of course, I have to cross the line because Once again, I‚Äôm an asshole. I‚Äôve perfected the art of snarky comments and straight-up insults thanks to everyone who thought it was hilarious to call me an idiot just to see what would happen. Well, I‚Äôll to you, if you light a fuse then it‚Äôll blow up in your face, especially if it‚Äôs short. Now to me, everything you do is full of flaws, reasons to start an argument. Who makes noodles with a spoon? That is definitely not how you make cookies. How can you live here and put the spatula in the wrong place every damn time? 

I‚Äôm not blaming you entirely, of course, I get mad for crappy reasons all the time, but if you point that out to me (which you always do) I‚Äôll just get madder. I wonder if you experience anger differently? For me anger is fire, it burns in my chest and the smoke clouds any rational thought that tells me. ‚ÄúYou know what, we shouldn‚Äôt be angry about this, how about we walk away and count to fifty.‚Äù After that, the flames die down and they only burn in my eyes. Because what kind of moron would cry after getting yelled at for arguing about ramen at 2 am? Now I can‚Äôt give you any kind of advice because you take it as criticism regardless of my intentions, which are mostly just whatever I think would be best at the time. Of course, what I think is right isn‚Äôt always the best course of action. And just you *love* reminding me of that, don‚Äôt you? So yeah, plot twist, we‚Äôre both assholes. You make fun of me to, my hobbies are just sad according to you. Playing the saxophone is so annoying since obviously, being able to hear the latest episode of *Riverdale* is far more important, (I now only practice the bare minimum for concert band.) To be fair I mostly do it for fine arts credits. Playing video games with your friends instead of basically living at the mall is just sad, and why is the crap you always cook so weird? Can‚Äôt you just only make things that my picky ass wants to eat? Hey, you know you would look so much better if you just ‚Ä¶dressed and did your makeup exactly the way I want you to. Oh, and I‚Äôll totally make fun of you when you apply makeup wrong or mix up terminologies because you never bothered getting into fashion. 

You see I tried to help you in the one way I could, by taking your advice and giving you some of my own. Yes, my short temper and general dickishness aren‚Äôt exactly my greatest assets, but I‚Äôm trying to fix them and it‚Äôs a lot harder then you think. I‚Äôm trying to be nicer, I hold doors open and bake cookies and a couple of people even think I‚Äôm actually nice. But you ‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt want to listen to anything I say because the words are coming out of *my* mouth and it‚Äôs a day ending in y. You wonder why I have to rely on other people to get obvious points across, but to you, I‚Äôm just dragging some poor soul into an argument we shouldn‚Äôt be having. I want to tell you, you have a gaping flaw in the way you think. You never want to try anything new because you're afraid you‚Äôll be bad at it. You refuse to wash certain dishes because you‚Äôve never washed them before and you don‚Äôt know how. You only want to do things you‚Äôve done before and nothing else, you‚Äôll never build new skill sets and someday this mentality will screw you ever. You're never going to listen to me though. In everyone else‚Äôs eyes, including my own parents, I‚Äôm normally the antagonist. I may not always start arguments, but I always escalate them, we‚Äôll end up arguing about two different things, each thinking the other is wrong. I‚Äôll raise my voice and yell and scream until the anger‚Äôs burnt out and I‚Äôm left feeling like an idiot. Which is why you should never listen to anything I say right? Wrong. 

But we‚Äôre twins, aren‚Äôt we? We share everything, for better or for worse. Friends, family, a house, we had the same room until the eighth grade. We share our love, our hatred, parts of our lives. And yet sometimes I just want to punch you in the face and make you just shut up and *listen* for once in our lives.

It is always better to process grief, anger, stress, frustration and other painful memories from your mind and body to begin living a more conscious life. And this can be done through [**anonymous venting**](https://www.ventallout.com/category/confession) of painful emotions.¬†

Discouragement of emotional expression is embedded in our society, i.e. men should not cry and women should not be aggressive. We bottle up or block emotions and they always remain in our unconscious or subconscious mind. If bottled up emotions are not expressed, they can hurt mentally and physically causing a distortion of mind and body.

It is very normal to have strong feelings. Give yourself permission to have them. There is no need to hide or deny what you are feeling. Healing emotion is a natural process. Exploring our emotions, feeling them, accepting them, and learning to deal with them in harmless ways can help us to live fuller and healthier lives.

"Today is my bio mother‚Äôs 53rd birthday. To celebrate, she wanted me to come over to have lobster and fries with her. I happily agreed as I was picturing hot, buttered, steamed lobsters served in the shell. The type that you have to crack open. We planned for me to come over at 7. When I got to her house (on time may I add), I was shocked to see nothing prepared. The fries weren‚Äôt ready and I found out that the lobster was the type that was served in a container. The cold, imitation lobster meat. I asked her why didn‚Äôt she ask me to pick up some steamed lobsters for her?? I was at the store buying her cake and I could have done it! They‚Äôre not expensive to buy, I can afford it. She didn‚Äôt give me an answer, just rudely shrugged her shoulders. I hope the lemon cake that I bought will save dinner because I will not be eating any of the other food, because that is disgusting. I regret coming over. I needed to rant because I can‚Äôt go off on my mom. Thanks for your time!",angry

My mom didn‚Äôt buy that. She bought imitation lobster meat. The kind that is out of the shell and that you can eat chilled. I asked her why didn‚Äôt she buy regular, normal lobster and she said she didn‚Äôt want to. What the F does that mean?? I could have bought the lobsters from the store myself when I was buying her cake. I‚Äôm so pissed right now. I regret coming over.

"We live in a complex of townhouses/condos.  There's a neighborhood association that regulates the parking lot.  My wife and I with our 2 cars have only 1 reserved spot...  Which is fine.  There's public space available in front of our townhouse.

Except...  when another neighbor who has TWO reserved spots in the parking lot decides to move his car in front of our house.  And leave it there until about 7:00 every day -- just about an hour after I get home.  At which time he *moves his car back* to one of his designated spots in the lot.

He parks there *just long enough* to make sure I have to park further away and walk, THEN moves it.  

So THAT is what is so infuriating.  He gains NOTHING by doing this -- except to inconvenience other people.  We have speculated that he's doing this to park in the shade during the hottest part of the day -- because he did stop last summer when the neighborhood association cut down the old trees (now the replacements have grown enough to cast a small shadow).  That's only specualtion... but SO THE FUCK WHAT?  Ev.Er.Y one ELSE has to just live with a hot car.  My car stays hot all damn day at work (which I go to, unlike this jackass) because there's no shade.  But this non-working (or, I guess, maybe works at night) ASSHOLE takes the time out of his day to move his car OUT of his assigned space(s) .... Jesus, I'm livid again just thinking about it.

------------------------


It's a public spot on the street.  Perfectly legal to do.  

My wife has left 2 notes on his car asking him to park in his own space(s) -- citing 1) her best friend having Huntingtons/handicapped parking permit (she's his only transportation as his movement has become so bad he can't drive) and 2) our other neighbor with a toddler who lives on the same section of curb.  To no avail.

This person has a reputation among the neighbors as being difficult.  Earned?  Don't know.  Too afraid of my own anger (and potentially losing it) to approaching him directly so far...

Maybe if I asked, he'd be understanding and park somewhere else?  Just hard to believe anyone in 2019 would take someone else's needs into consideration without being forced -- such is the shitty world in which we live.",angry

"I was accidentally made aware that one of my fellow classmates at my community college just succeeded at a goal that I‚Äôve been working towards for years.I have been trying to find an internship that would help me earn weeks towards AEA membership via the EMC program.A couple days ago when I was on campus I saw a postcard for a play then googled the school.When I found the apprenticeship that one of my classmates landed,my heart dropped.When I could see with my own eyes someone succeeding where I have failed so horribly,it makes me wish that I was dead.I was jealous of him in that what does he have that I do not?He is very attractive &amp; I am not.He doesn‚Äôt have social anxiety &amp; I do.His parents had jobs &amp; mine were losers living off disability.I can‚Äôt even get up from this bed most days nowadays because of depresssion.My classmate‚Äôs success has fucked me up right now.The weight of my failure is so strong.I just came back from my therapist a few hours ago &amp; I could not bring myself to tell him I feel like dying.I still have a 5 week summer class to finish.I made a promise to my scene partner.Fuck me.

Fuck me,why do I make promises when I can‚Äôt even succeed at any goal at all?My scene partner needs me for next week‚Äôs performance.But when I realized that this classmate succeeded where I failed,I was brought to my knees.Some guy I dont even know just succeeded at my goal,my heart dropped.He‚Äôs kind of cute.Maybe that‚Äôs why they cast him.At least that‚Äôs why the theater dept at my college keeps casting him,I think.

The drama teacher that dominates my major can‚Äôt wait to retire.I‚Äôm tired of hearing her shit these past few weeks.

Fuck her........her ass has had tenure for 15+ years &amp; she thinks working there 25 years makes her a queen?

I don‚Äôt give a damn which fancy drama school you went to.

When I‚Äôm in class you‚Äôre going to respect me &amp; stop talking over me like I‚Äôm your damn kid.

I‚Äôm a grown adult &amp; so is every other person in my current shakespeare workshop class.

First day of this class I ask her why anyone would take 4 levels (only the first is required for the degree as each additional level is essentially excessive units accumulate) she tells us bs like ‚Äúyou should want to because I‚Äôve been running this workshop for 20 years‚Äù

*Translation:This department is broke &amp; needs the money so shut up &amp; give us your money.*

That‚Äôs not a fucking reason for me to line your damn pockets.

Why can‚Äôt she just do her fucking job &amp; stop talking about retirement thats over a year away?

I‚Äôm not paying her to waste class time talking about fucking retirement.

There is no way that I can take Intermediate Acting with this woman in the Fall......she will literally spend half the class talking about retirement.

Noone else teaches that class at my college.

Fuck me &amp; Fuck her.

Why can‚Äôt someone cast me for once instead of some cute guy with perfect hair?

My classmate is so damn cute (at least,to me) &amp; I‚Äôm so damn angry,jealous &amp; depressed that the universe felt the need to show me why I‚Äôm a loser.

I know I‚Äôm not making any sense but I am so damn angry that this guy got an apprenticeship &amp; earned some weeks towards Equity &amp; I didn‚Äôt.

You can‚Äôt understand how fucked up I feel right now.

It was very competitive &amp; he sure got lucky this summer.

Lucky bastard.

I applied for three internships this summer (to earn Equity weeks) but some attractive blond university student with a car probably got it instead of me.

I‚Äôm a poor community college student that takes the bus with curly black hair.üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶±

Despite my efforts to better my life the universe is telling me ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù.

Fuck my experienced tenured drama professor that can‚Äôt wait to retire so she can take her sweet ass pension to AZ &amp; leave my college to replace her with someone with much less experience.

Fuck the three professional theater companies that rejected me for an internship I really needed.

Fuck *California Lutheran University* that gave my classmate an apprenticeship that I needed just as much as he did,even more.

Fuck my community college because despite all my efforts to earn their respect star actors like my classmate above &amp; other *better* acting students are royalty in their eyes.

Fuck all my drama professors again for treating me like a damn shelter pet because I haven‚Äôt been in any of their plays by choice of the 25 years experienced ‚Äúqueen‚Äú above.

Fuck one of my acting professors from last Fall that wasted half our fucking classtime reminiscing about his glory days at UCLA.

Fuck that same professor for ignoring me when I said I had social anxiety &amp; pretending that over half the class didn‚Äôt have anxiety too.

Again Fuck that same professor for constantly bringing in his favorite advanced students (including my classmate above) who ‚Äúhave been in 3,4,5 etc of my plays‚Äù so they could fucking show off in front me in his beginning acting class while he drooled praise over them.

Fuck my professors lack of understanding of people with autism &amp; similar conditions because instead of them getting mental health training they treat me like a wet dog or a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù just because I was raised by people too stupid to not use birth control.

Fuck my parents for not using birth control,not getting an abortion &amp; then raising kids in poverty.

Fuck me for still breathing.

Fuck my lack of a lucky charm.

"Im angry at the way i was raised, how im ending up at my failures as well as my inability to get to where i was at my high point. Im angry at how power dynamics in life work. people get blamed scapegoated punished. innocent people or people who do good get hurt all the time. you can play it differently. and try to play it well enough youll find yourself almost forced to be cruel to others. I feel that people anywhere you go are almost ignorant to these dynamics. something goes wrong? its in our nature to want someones head chopped off. something goes right we credit them and love them. often times the wrong person. all that hard work can mean nothing. your the grunt? you get treated like one no matter how much you care or how much good you do. your on top of things? its bound to crumble. the way we are our human nature is cruel. your born defected or not as good as others? your genes will die as those who do good will continue to thrive. the weak die and the strong survive. Beat as a kid? were all in the same world and you will have an endless amount of work to put in that gets credited as nothing to a decent amount of people. or you can embrace the toxicity of your actions. make the people hate you, be crazy and feel the bliss. if you take responsibility for your wrong doings you will find yourself punished and have other peoples wrong doings put on you. you thrive when you blame others its sick. and when your left with feelings of anger resentment they sit with you. for some their whole lives. they want to kill. some people do. those who have the courage to start feeling free. if they kill or go after the wrong person they feel a need to do so again and again. we often times arnt grounded to reality. we will do the wrong things and punish the wrong people. nobody can be completely grounded to reality. things can be undeservably cruel. some think the world is fair. so they will try to confirm it to the best of the abilty. if someone with that belief sees a man homeless starving. they fail to give care or empathy and blame him. itd be the homeless mans responsibilty to take care of himself and hed likely blame himself they know that. but to confirm there right for their pride. they are almost forced to think poorly of him. same goes to anyone whos in a bad spot. the unfortanate are like the plauge. it truly is in our interest to avoid them if we would like to see success. 

im not happy with the way im left to feel. theres a lot of anger. a lot. its unseen and never talked about. i listen and listen hear you out make you feel like i completely understand you make you like me. while im completely detached. its cold. and you dont get to see how cold i am. doesnt matter if we had a close conversation. im alone. thats just how i feel.

there are two people in this world who have been hurt as kids unfairly and have grown up and hurt there kids who i want to hurt and who i blame. they were once victims. they were once innocent babies. it isnt them whose to blame but the cold nature of it. theve suffered so they feel its fair to make others suffer. they are detatched from reality so they cant see the dynamics they are in. its life that does this but my anger is pointed towards them. everyday i feel the anger and resentment. i can act out on it feel that freedom from it but be locked behind bars or i can work on it. 

this world is cruel, fuck you life and the way you work.",angry

"I have been extremely exhausted lately. and yes, this is an annoying thing to hear regularly but it is even more frustrating to be exhausted and nobody take you seriously.

I came to visit my parents. they never use A.C I have a serious intolerance to the heat. I have not slept the past two nights waking up every two hours. 

I have had a similar issue for some time but usually get at least 4 hours.

I just got over a bug where I was vomiting+ other symptoms associated with the typical bug. I am. it sure if it is the heat or that bug but I feel hungover and nauseous. 

Everyone around me is convinced my problem is due to not eating right, smoking cigarettes, using a computer, and not calling a doctor. 

I have a chronic health condition so doctors essentially say ""there is nothing we can do until real damage has begun"" A.K.A your condition appears dormant and your symptoms are not specific enough to pin to anything we can write a script for.

of course this makes me angry! I hate myself for being such a bad friend. I never want to go anywhere or do anything because I just feel exhausted not to mention, if I do go out I'm always so negative, I never want to do much, I don't seem happy, and I appear stressed.

I don't even have anyone really in my life. Just the ones who are for whatever reason only seem to want me to be someone to go to a concert with. The fact I am not feeling well must be that I am depressed, maybe have diabetes, not eating enough, not being healthy, or generally unable to take care of myself. 

Why does everyone have to tell me what I'm not doing? it is so easy to do this! I don't have a car right now for frustrating reasons (I have one, just due to health issues my parents don't feel it is safe for me to have one...yet expect me to walk to an appointment otherwise I obviously don't care enough about my health...or other guilt-like statements that I am entitled, selfish, and lazy)

Unfortunately, I know I will obsess over my actions and see myself as a selfish kid who couldn't push themselves to be polite. but it is hard to without any sleep. I don't understand how people can argue this but they can't imagine waking up early one night? I wish people would leave me alone. If I don't share how I feel I'm an asshole without a cause. If I do share I'm selfish, stuck in my own head, and need to do something about it. 

I can't help though but feel it would help if maybe someone would just say ""it is okay"". 

I mean. I will probably see a doctor but last time I had all these tests done that didn't even seem related and told I look normal!",angry
"Well seems like theres no bbq tonight. Mom decided to make meatloaf instead when she could have at least done burgers it on the stove top. The other day she said she was gonna clean the grill out since some birds were building nests in them. Next thing is she turns around saying the opposite thing she was gonna do and is making meatloaf in the oven instead on a special day like this for family gathering and bbq. I'm not surprised since she did this same sort of thing on one of my birthdays where i never asked for much then she changes it up pissing me off in the process. Then i start asking her about me thinking she was gonna make bbq for dinner tonight then she gave me excuses about working a lot on freelance projects besides not getting around to cleaning the grill out but, it was pretty hot outside since it was 90 degrees F after checking the weather. If she at least did burgers on the stove top besides other things then i wouldn't be pissy about it right now from her being a flat out hypocrite.

" 

So, I‚Äôm staying at my grandmother‚Äôs house for a few days, and today ‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt exactly great.

This morning, when the two of us were out, we ended up meeting up with one old friend of hers, Mrs. JB. They ended up chatting and all, and I let the two of them, I didn‚Äôt want to be rude so I didn‚Äôt speak and only spoke when I was asked something, that is also one small part of why she got offended.

So let‚Äôs move to the thing that made me mad. My grandmother ended up saying that I should go to a cinema with Mrs JB grandson, some dude named D that I only know the name of and that he has the same age as me, and implied that she would stay out of the cinema room. And now you know why I‚Äôm mad, she was basically setting me up on a date, without my opinion on the matter and acted like I wasn‚Äôt there, so I (obviously) said ‚Äòno‚Äô while Mrs. JB made a face and looked away the moment my grandma stopped speaking (which weirdly enough my dear ol‚Äô relative simed to miss), and my grandma got, you guessed it, OFFENDED!

Later on, when we doing some stuff before we went home, she tried to berate/convince me about the whole cinema ordeal, she even used the ‚Äòhe is your friend‚Äô(Idk that you could be friends by just knowing the name and age of a person), ‚Äòhe is the son of your mother's childhood friend‚Äô(good for them, like, I probably never meet him and it shouldn‚Äôt make a difference about whether or not I would go on a date with a dude that, again, I DON‚ÄôT KNOW), ‚Äòit wouldn't be a date‚Äô (you FREAKING IMPLIED THAT IT WOULD BE) and she then said that she would be in the room, even though she implied that she wouldn‚Äôt be, and acted like I was angry at her with no reason.

AND now she is acting like the fight didn‚Äôt happen.",angry

"Me &amp; my two brothers raised in the deepest of poverty in Southeast U.S. by disabled parents living solely off of disability.In 2008,we were evicted twice that year because one of my brothers finally lost his damn mind.He kept getting in fights with management &amp; other kids involved in criminal activity where we lived so we lost our home because of his stupidity.He had many low level convictions for assault &amp; petty drug posession (marijuana) as a young man.Lots of fighting &amp; anger over the lack of resources &amp; no dignity living in the ghetto.Being excluded from after school clubs because we didn‚Äôt have a car &amp; I couldn‚Äôt miss the school bus.Personally myself,I was viciously bullied in middle school to the point that recently I was diagnosed with social communication disorder.One day in a science class in middle school a big angry girl kept pulling my hair in class.My middle school years at a low income public school were the worst years of my life.I wanted to die every day because my parents forced me into this hellish existence.My father was a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness &amp; didn‚Äôt believe in abortion.After producing three children,they finally realized that maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have any more kids because they were broke as fuck.I believe that my youngest brother (I have two brothers) was an accident because there is a seven year gap between me &amp; him.There is a five year gap between the two brothers. If I had been evaluated a few years prior,I would be on the autism spectrum (aspergers).All of this suffering could‚Äôve been avoided if my parents simply had the goddamn sense to not reproduce.My father had schizophrenia &amp; in his case was also a former alcoholic &amp; had tuberculosis as a teen.He was messed up seven ways till sunday but still had kids anyway.That is a level of selfishness &amp; ignorance that transcends all common sense.He also wouldn‚Äôt led me go anywhere alone (females need protection) but my 2 brothers ran buck wild.I‚Äôm 31 years old &amp; these events occurred between 10 &amp;15 years ago (between the years of 2000-2008) but I‚Äôm very bitter over it.My therapist asked me if I wished I had been aborted &amp; I couldn‚Äôt answer the question but I was tempted to say yes.These two people who were broke as fuck condemned me to exist when they didnt have two pennies between them.Then society fucks me over as an adult because I have no motivation or work ethic.Oh yeah &amp; when my dad dies (he‚Äôs about 80 years old,I can‚Äôt remember) my mother will be alone &amp; broke because he has no life insuranc.I can‚Äôt take my mother in &amp; we have no family for her to go to.

I was fucking raised by wolves on a $1000/year income.What the fuck do you expect from me?

So my husband and I just got married about 3 months ago and we just went to his family's reunion. He's the youngest in the family so he has a lot of nieces and nephews. He has this one niece who is 15. They're super close and used to talk a lot when their family lives closer. Well within the first 5 minutes we get there we're all sitting in a circle in chairs and we're sitting right by her and he's playing footsie with her and I was just really thrown off by it. They were just pretty close the whole trip and they like also slow danced together. I'm new to the family and he says that's just how their relationship is and that they're close but it just seems weird to me. Like is it just me? I feel like it's not normal for an Uncle niece relationship. Now I know that nothing is going on there but I just feel that it's innapropriate considering that she a 15 year old female. I don't see a problem with it if she was a little kid but I feel like you have to be more aware of boundaries as they get older. He thinks I'm just being ridiculous though because I'm new to the family and don't know the history of their relationship and that they've always been like that.,angry
"So I work at a bank. Well, today I had a customer in the drive thru that seemed nice at first.

Her daughter in the back seat sees the lollipop, gets super excited and starts kind of jumping in her seat slightly. My customer then reached back and beat the ever living mess out of this poor child telling her to ‚ÄúSit the fuck back down‚Äù over a lollipop that wasn‚Äôt even her child‚Äôs fault. The way she beat her over and over again in that moment reminded me of someone beating an animal or pet. It‚Äôs all I could see. My mouth dropped and I was baffled.

Me and my friend overtook this guy with a table or something on one of them trolley thing. At the end of the path was a crossing, it crossed the main lights and was one of the ones that you had to press a button and wait for green man to show. 
Before we reached the end we overtook a man in the green/blue shirt. As we where going down the path , we where ringing our bells to let people know that we where coming. When we got to the traffic lights , the man came up behind us (blue shirt man )and said something along the lines of:
Angry man: ‚ÄúOi, can you stop ringing your bell you fucking cunts‚Äù 

We stared at each over confused 
Angry man : ‚Äú stop fucking grinning, its not funny!‚Äù

Then the man with the table came over to the crossing as well and overheard the conversation and said 
Other man : ‚Äú can you stop swearing at those kids ‚Äú
Me and my friend this point just cycled away as we where fed up of this idiot. 
I thank god that other guy came in and helped out as that guy was very rude , 
I said to my friend that he would moan both ways 
A. 
- if we did ring my bell he would get triggerd 

B
- if we didn't ring our bells , he would of stepped out in front of of and got hit , and then would complain 

So both ways he would of been angry

"Now thats a fucking joke right there. Ive honestly never seen such grade A imperialist nonsense trotted out in this day and age, only for it to receive the plaudits of the ignorant online mob. 

India is a big fucking place. Development has occurred at different paces in different places. In the Indus Valley civilisation, which is comparable in age to Mesopotamia itself, cities were designed in grid patterns for ease of expansion and construction and every home had its own plumbing system for waste. Thats right; India had indoor toilets and municipal sewers 5000 years prior to their adoption by western societies. 

The great cultural works, the Ramasayana and the Mhabarata are the oldest spiritual and historical texts in the world. Within them there are demonstrations not just of indias development of ethics and politics but also of science, whilst most of europe were running around the woods in rags and sacrificing their children to weather gods. 

The concepts of pacifism, respect and love, the sovereignty of self, of karmic balance were introduced to Europe via the new testament of the bible, which was essentially a repackaging of eastern (indian and chinese) philosophies that had already been around for hundreds and sometimes thousands of years. Yet the white barbarians used those peaceful teachings to justify another thousand years of bloodlust and conquest, transforming a philosophy of peace into a cause for war time and time again.

By the time the british arrived in india, it was home to an advanced manufacturing sector. In terms of textiles, dyes and spices, agricultural techniques India was leagues ahead of the British and had no equal in the world. The British exploited the fractitious political environment of the time, when the Muhgal were on the wane, to sieze control of great swathes of the country. From there, they demolished the indian textile industry so that the textile mills of england would no longer have to compete with superior indian products. The agricultural sector was also repurposed from food production supporting and feeding millions of Indians into the production of drugs and spices. Opium was harvested and used as a weapon to destroy the neighbouring chinese empire by making a nation of addicts, tea and other spices were traded across the world for the sole gain of monopolist trade companies and indians were left to starve in the millions.

How on earth do you get the gall to suggest that Europeans are these benevolent gods dispensing the fruits of science to the unwashed hordes of tribal savages? Did you just freshly step out of the 18th century? Are you really that ignorant of global history, yet still feel empowered to mock the ignorance of other cultures?

However, today I'm pissed.

I was walking home from work tonight and three Japanese men in their 20s were walking behind me. One of them noticed I was foreign and told the others ""It's a gaijin"" (a slightly less than PC word for foreigner)
One of the three then yelled ""YOU'VE GOT A PIG'S ARSE"" at me and another said, in a somewhat quieter yet still raised voice ""show me your tits.""

So I had just got out of the shower and I realise my friend hid all my clothes, money and my phone so when I found them all after 10minutes of searching and him being a dick about it I say ""Fuck you dude, suck my dick"" and laugh and then he just fucking pounces on me, rips my clean shirt I had just put on and takes my belt and hits me with it when I punch him and push him away he says ""Dude, chill, why are you so mad?"" I just tell him that he's a huge fucking dick and put on my headphones and try to chill and not get even more mad. Also he always hits my chest and is a huge dick for some reason.

HOW DARE YOU CALL ME TO ASK THIS!? And as an after thought, talk to my daughter. You're a lousy POS, and you always will be. Eff you.",angry
"I understand that liquor store owners have the right and obligation to refuse service to those who they believe are intoxicated and I respect that.  I haven't had anything to drink today, hell I haven't had anything to drink in a week.  I go to the liquor store to get a six pack of beer to celebrate a new job after a long day outside with the family.  As soon as I walk in the manager looks at me and walks behind the counter, I don't think anything of it, but when I get there the employee he is training asks ""Sir, have you had anything to drink tonight?""  I respond ""no I haven't""  he says ""your eyes are pretty red.""  I tell him the truth ""My eyes are red because of allergies, when I wear contacts too long this time of year they get this bad because I can't use my allergy eye drops"".  The manager steps in and insists ""Are you sure you haven't had anything to drink tonight?  A guy left the bar across the street recently and side swiped some high school girls"".  At this point it becomes excruciatingly clear that no matter what I say this guy isn't going to believe it, he is dead set that I'm absolutely plastered because my eyes are red.  ""No I haven't had anything to drink, my eyes are red because of allergies.  If you aren't going to sell to me I'll just go to a store that understands.""  ""That's a good idea, thank you.""  I'm livid, I have friends who can no longer walk because of drunk drivers and this guy has decided that my red eyes mean I'm driving around town plastered.  I get stuck in a situation where nothing I say will change what he already has going on in his head.  I used to drive further to go to this store because the workers there were pretty cool and it seemed like a family owned business,  but I guess I just have to take my money elsewhere.",angry

"I have anger issues and whenever pressure makes me crack(no pun intended), I explode. I kick things, throw things, recently I slightly lifted up a chair at a salon and tried to destroy it because my parents were forcing me to go to a shitty market that has no bags and buy soda and gatorade an hour after I accidentally smashed my thumb with a car door. I flip out at anyone who tries to hold me back, tell me to calm down, or continuously provoke me, the latter usually involves someone getting hurt. After a serious incident that happened at school that I mentioned in my last post here, my mom accused me of using drugs and my retarded dad didn't take that possibility out of the equation, as if they know what a druggie acts like, even though I've had these anger issues all my life and can remember times I expressed them throughout. It pisses me off so bad and makes me want to assault my parents.",angry
"Jesus fucking christ I don't know where to begin. A little over a year my dad lost his cushy government job and was unemployed for several months before eventually become a manager for a call center company. During the time he was unemployed my parents blew through all my college savings and made absolutely zero lifestyle changes despite the fact we had no form of income. My dad really struggled to get a new job because he had a felony and a lot of scandals associated with him so what he did end up with paid a little more than a teacher's salary. My mom has refused to get a job during this entire process and so there is nothing subsidizing our income except for my part time fast food job which I use to pay for my own expenses. Despite struggling to even live paycheck to paycheck they refuse to take some very basic steps which would really help us financially. For starters, we live in a home worth almost half a million dollars yet they refuse to sell it and downgrade. There's no reason to keep it, I'm an only child so all the extra bedrooms are just unused, and the house cost soo fucking much to maintain. They still use a fancy landscaping service for our yard and refuse to just buy a lawn mower because ""Lawn mowers are expensive"" Yet when I've found some nice free lawn mowers on craigslist they always make up an excuse as to why I can't get it and it's really frustrating. My mom still won't get a job, they still take our dogs to a high end dog groomer, and my dad eats out for lunch every single day at work. Today, despite being really low on money my parents decided to go to estate sales all day and buy some shitty fake tribal mask and a breadmaker which cost $75. Literally yesterday my dad was complaining how he couldn't afford to give me money for deodorant and hand soap. My dad is so awful to me any time I call him out for his mismanagement of our finances and it's really taking a toll on me. While my parent's live a life of luxury they tell me they can't afford to pay for me to get a haircut, or buy tampons, basic stuff like that. I have a pretty strong feeling that they also stole several hundred dollars of my graduation money because my mom told me she had my granddad wire the money to their bank account instead of mine and that they'd give it to me once it went through, but it's been well over a week so it should have by now. I have to pay for college with no assistance because of them, and I don't qualify for any need based financial aid because the income on my FAFSA is from my dads old job.  I just wish they would wake the fuck up and see how much harm they are doing to themselves and much this has affected me. 

Okay rant over, this is very ""first world problems"" I guess but it's really taking a toll on me",angry

"My best friend of 13 years is like a sister to me. We do everything together and we have always been there for eachother. Until recently. We both went through a tough time where we didn't have vehicles, i just happened to get mine fixed before she bought hers, so i was doing most of the driving. I would drive to her house three times a week, i would drive us to the store and out to eat. Now that she has a car, she refuses to come over to my house or get a job so I'm stuck driving and paying for every fun thing we do. The other day, we decided to go swimming so i put my drivers license in her beach bag for safe keeping. I totally forgot it and told her about it today. I asked her if she could please drive over to my house and drop off my license because i couldn't drive without it. It's been 8 hours and she just now told me she was leaving her boyfriend's buddies house and she'll be here in an hour... So she can drive an hour to a party but she can't take 15 minutes out of her day to drop off an important piece of plastic?? Or 15 minutes just to hang out with me? I'm so mad at her right now. I'm annoyed and irritated. Mostly hurt. Because i live in an apartment where smoking wax is not allowed and there is a noise curfew, that means I'm too boring to visit. I have to drive to her house after a long day of work and watch her smoke wax and do nothing because it's her safe space and she doesn't want to leave it unless I'm paying for the entertainment. She depends on her boyfriend, parents and me for everything and I'm getting really sick of this. I have to wake up early for work tomorrow and I'm stuck waiting for her to drop off my license. I'm exhausted, my body is ready for bed. This friendship feels one sided now and i feel like I'm being used.",angry
"I figure I should place down some context first before I say anything about my problem: I am too young to move out of my house, if I was old enough, you know I'd be getting 3 different jobs and paying for my own home. But the one I currently live in with my family feels like a punishment from God himself, I know people have it far worse than me, but it feels like I am in literal hell. I get blamed for everything and yelled at for things my siblings do, I can't find a friend in pets because my parents wouldn't get me a dog if I asked and even then, they'd probably take them away in the next week, and I have bad anger issues that my parents won't help me solve. Everyday I go to school, talk with my friends and do my work, and I'm probably the one person there that thinks that's more enjoyable than going home. Because when I do go home, I have to stay in my room in fear of getting in trouble and play videogames for the rest of the day and usually night until the morning. Sometimes I go outside for a few hours (I have ADHD so I like to go in my backyard, sometimes put on some music, go to the side of my house where I can't be seen, walk in circles and just think about anything) but when I come back inside I continue this miserable lifestyle of sleeping and sitting on my ass. I could so something to change this but I have no motivation. It's not like I'm fat and live in a basement, I'm very skinny and have my own room that causes me even more despair despite it being the only place in my home that I'm happy in. So I have the ability to better myself, but like I said before, there is nothing that makes me want to, nothing that makes me want to break this shitty cycle. At school, I have a large friend group but it's summer vacation so I'm gonna have to take a break from them for a while. I HAD a large friend group on my street a few years ago but all of my friends moved so I have none at home to hang out with. The only person I like in my house is occasionally my dad, he's the only person in my family that gets proud of me when I do something and he's really the only reason I haven't stabbed myself in the heart. Now that I've already strolled into the topic of my mental health, might as well begin to take it there.

My mother enrages me to the fullest, she pushes me to cry and when I do end up crying she acts like I'm supposed to be some emotionless creature. I remember a few years ago when she pushed me into crying and screaming about wanting to kill myself and the way she just shrugged me off. There is far too much pressure in my house that is kept which leads to the smallest thing making me explode. The one reason I joined this community to make this post was because I began to have violent thoughts of beating her into a pool of blood if she even dared open the door to my room that I am in right now laying in bed. I have cracked so many times before and it made some of my friends leave, I threatened them and it was solved at school, fortunately when I'm not mad I don't remain this brutal foul beast so I spoke to the disciplinary people properly and I got away with a 5 day suspension. I was supposed to have counseling after that but it was never given to me. By the grace of whatever being walks among us, my friends came back, I apologized to them, and that helped me a little bit. But that doesn't change how terribly I feel when I am at my house, I want to run away so bad. I want to KILL myself. Honestly I do feel like if my mother walks into my room and begins screaming at me to clean it I will push her down the staircase. My dad wants to take me to his little workplace and I have gone a few times and done some work but the thing is that I'm too awkward to talk to the customers and tell them things like how I can't read their handwriting and it has resulted in me putting incorrect information into the computer. I would go but I don't have motivation to do that either. I had to put away a plate because my mother got on my ass about how all I do is eat when I rarely get the opportunity, since like I said, I'm about as skinny as it gets. I could go on and on about the coping methods I attempt but they are all very unhealthy. I don't indulge in self harm or anything like that, but it doesn't make it fine. I just feel like I need some advice from people like me who deal with anger so I can progress somewhere instead of fearing the future and everything else.",angry

"I recently got into Tekken 7 last month, picked a new chatacter to learn, spent hours practicing everything.

And I still got my ass beat, but that's just how fighting games are. I've learned to accept that.

But these types of games tend to get me more angry than most types of games because of the fact that their 1v1, can't say I had a bad team or whatever. If I lose its 100% on me.

I was trying to play a relaxing night of Tekken but that shit got to me. I think it was just the little things added over time.

I was losing every single matchup tonight, and the thing is the matchmaker will then put me against new players or people just starting out with a different character. And it just makes me feel like shit honestly, like what it's telling me is that I can only beat noobs, that shit sucks. Then I went straight into losing again.

In a fit of rage I ended up destroying my fightstick. It ended up cutting my hand a little. Now that my rage has subsided I wish I had better control over it when I play. I do try to calm down and take breaks from the gane etc. But it doesn't hell that when I try again I just lose again.

Now I have to find another fight stick and toss my broken one. Not a good night for me. 

TL:DR fighting games make me more mad than anything else, broke my expensive controller from raging, have to get a replacement. I wish I was better.",angry

"The universe is an uncaring, meaningless place. We're placed on this earth to suffer pain, diseases, hunger and the overwhelming existential dread of our own mortality.

And how do we humans respond to this? By being needlessly cruel to others.

Bullshit, we all are just good at mental gymnastics to make ourselves the hero no matter how callous we act. We victim blame the people We hurt. ""I'm bullying them to toughen them up"" bullshit, we all are sadistic monsters that revel in causing suffering, likely for some primitive notion of machismo so we can bang our chests like the fucking shit flinging troglodytes we all have always been.

We all would gleefully put people in camps if they're not part of our ""tribe"".

But the biggest reason I hate us all?

The world is literally dying and human civilization continues to ignore it and instead elect increasingly more half witted politicians because of some anti-PC crusade that has greatly eclipsed any political correctness movement in intensity and obnoxiousness. Because somehow ""we should respect people"" is a more odious choice to us all than ""we should let the planet die"".

I'm so angry because he keeps hiding behind the ""just get over it"" mentality, like this is shit that isn't a big deal like it's just SO fucking easy to get over at the very least being abused for a large portion of my life.  It's at the very least insensitive, and it sucks because at some points in my childhood I even tried reaching out to him (he and my mother were divorced) to tell him what was happening multiple times, and he ignored me.

Now, I'm 25, and he keeps demanding that I ""respect"" him because ""he's my father"" when he was never involved in my life save for giving me money to get me off his back in recent years.  

It also just feeds into my anger at... I dunno, everything for having been #Blessed with such amazingly horrible parents.  And it reminds me of how alone I felt back then, when I dealt with all of this with no one to talk to.",angry

"Ok so why in green grass did my holiday make me want to jump in the ocean to kill a shark well they could 2 times a day play baby shark 

Ok so when I went on holiday I herd it once on the first day in the after noon to be honest it was ok I had no problem with the song yeah it was annoting but the animation I found on you tube made me cringe first time as well as the tiktok adds which were cringy but I herd worse and seen worse

So one night I went to sit down and play my tablet that's when I hear it...Dana Dana..  Dana Dana danadanadana I opened my window to see what was going on and well it was the night show and it was a kids segment and well off course they played baby shark so it was two times I was fine with it and well the next day I herd the Dana bit again then I realised what was going on 

I had to sit in my room listening to the song 2 time or 3 a day I was mad...REALLY MAD like why do you play the most annoying song on 3 times I think if you over play the song over and over guests will start getting sick of it and don't get me started with the children they would get sucked into the song like it's a vacuum cleaner 

I had to put up with that song for a fortnight and I just kept thinking to my self take me home Scottish roads and get back to horrible weather so I could escape that God forsaken song 

I don't think I can look at sharks anymore with out thinking the song baby shark and it finally left thank God cus I'd rather be in the downpours of Glasgow with the MIXED weather just so I don't hear that's stupid song 2 or 3 times on holiday",angry
"New quiet coworker comes in every day, and keeps to herself.  Sits alone at lunch time, and I never see people talk to her.  I make small talk, and tell her she's doing great.  Weeks turn to months, and she walks over to make (very) small talk for 1-2 minutes.

She's applying for another job, and I encourage her.  She got a new hair cut, and I tell her it looks nice and summery.  We fist bump, and she walks away.

2-3 days later I'm called into the store managers office:  I've been accused of sexually harassing her.  I went kind of numb (Shock?) and just sat there like I was in a dream.  I'm told corporate is going to look into it, and I'll need to have a statement ready.

I'm innocent, and about 75% sure the company will understand if they can't prove her claim, then they better not do more than have a stern conversation with me, but either way, my reputation is destroyed.  Once you're labeled a pervert (innocent or not) you're **always** going to be seen as a creep.

I can't be mad at my employer:  They're doing their job.  They have to investigate.  But what about that piece of shit?  WHY did she make this claim to the (seemingly) only friend she had?  Money?  Is she trying to sue our employer for money??

What can I do??  Even if I somehow got her to confess, I'm still a slime ball.  I'm mad as hell, and powerless to do anything.  Even if she had money, which she definitely does not, suing her for financial gain doesn't restore my name!

"English not first language and also pissed off, so if spelling and shit is bad, then too bad for u. 

I‚Äôve known the guy for 10 years, I‚Äôve helped babysit the kid when he was forced to come into work bc of some accident, we‚Äôve done trips together with my 2 daughters (I‚Äôm a divorced dad) who are a couple of years older. We‚Äôve talked about opening a computer/hobby/games store together, he‚Äôs helped me several times when I wasn‚Äôt mentally stable because of stress after divorce, economy and other shit. 

In short: I‚Äôve always seen him as a straight up bro. 2 guys, dealt bad hands in lifes poker game, helping each other out. 
Like bros. 

And the kid is a genuine angel. Kind to everyone, grateful for everything and never acting entitled, unlike her mom. The kind of kid I would adopt in a heart beat if something were to happen to her parents.
And he fucking does... this... molests his own daugther...
I hope, for his sake, if he survives prison, that we never meet again, because I don‚Äôt know what the fuck I will do to him if we do meet. 

And one of the worst parts of this story is that the kid‚Äôs mom (they separated when daughter was 2y. She‚Äôs 9 now) has always been an entitled brat her whole life, constantly accusing family members of molesting her when she didn‚Äôt get what she wanted.  
That, as you probably understand, has lead to that nobody took her serious when she first started accusing him of stuff about 2 years ago. Cry wolf, and all that. Friends, me included, aswell as her own brother, took his side, defending him, certain that she was just up to her regular shenanigans when she didn‚Äôt get sole custody after some fighting between them a couple of years ago. 
So if she hadn‚Äôt been an entitled brat her whole life, her daughter might have not had to live thru 2 years of this shit.

I don‚Äôt know what to fucking do. I‚Äôm angry at myself for not noticing, I‚Äôm fucking furious at him for hurting her, and I‚Äôm angry at her mom for acting such a way that no one would ever take her seriously if anything ever WOULD happen to her for real.

I‚Äôm at a fucking loss here. I‚Äôm even ashamed to meet the kid again, blaming myself for being so blind. 

Fucking shit, all of this.
And i can only imagine what the kids uncle feel, after ignoring his sister and defending our former bro. 

Fuck this shit",angry

"So I work at a grocery store. I usually do maintenance (cleaning up shit inside the store) but I also can do carts (cleaning up *carts,* *outside* the store).

The usual guy who does carts decided to go on a two-week vacation, for no other reason 'oh I'll loose the time if I don't use it'. So on the week of the 12th, I get slapped with _all_ of his hours - working Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. That's one day off.

The *next* week, I get slapped with a similar hour count - Sunday, Monday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. That is a full six days inbetween days off, and I spent those days off worried sick about a new food allergy. 

So yesterday is the day I get my next schedule, and I'm happy that things are going to finally go back to normal with the usual carts guy coming back from vacation. 

And then I find out that no. 

They do not. 

I am working Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday this week. Continuing from last week, that is *seven* days until a *single* day off, and then I come in for *one* day before I get another, *single* day off.

Does the manager even fucking pay attention to morale when he's doing scheduling? Does he pay attention at *all?* Does he give a shit about his employees' mental health? If everyone's schedules are this fucking disorganized, no wonder there's such a high turnaround on already shitty positions like cashier.

And I can't even confront him about it, because *obviously* he's the manager and *obviously* he knows shit better than I can ever hope to.",angry

"I‚Äôve gained weight. It‚Äôs obvious. I used to fit really nice into size 7 jeans. Not anymore, but size 9 got me too loose too. My husband has gained weight and he said we were going to join the gym to work out together.

He lied. He constantly complains about being fat, but won‚Äôt take the initiative to do something about it.

On the other hand, I feel he‚Äôs doing it on purpose. One night, many moons ago, he confessed he didn‚Äôt want to let me have a gym membership  because ‚ÄúI might not want him when I get in shape and more attractive dudes notice me.‚Äù Like bruh, I married you. I‚Äôm not changing my mind.

Has he bothered to me buy me new jeans? Nope. New shirts? Nope. Nada. 

I‚Äôve cried because my jeans hurt me a lot. I can‚Äôt exercise outside on my own because the landlord is always here fixing the house behind us, and takes any little time due when we‚Äôre outside so no use using the yard at all.

"Holy f*cking sh*t

So my grandfather (who is a russian living in Western Europe)  wants to send a present to his relative in Russia. 
He brought it to the post office and they offered him a special service.
He sent it and today we got a letter about how it can‚Äôt be sent. I was on the phone with this (actually halfway nice and competent) lady from the main office exchanging different types of receipts until she realized that we weren‚Äôt a company. Because apparently only companies are allowed to use this d*mn special service. The man in the post office however told us that it‚Äôs for everyone and one does not need to include and sort of receipt or be a company. Now we‚Äòre waiting for the package to return to go to the post office. Now it appears that we, the customers, have to go there and tell them to investigate shit about what exactly happened and hand the lady from the main office on the phone over to the workers in the post office here. 
So all in all there‚Äôs some kind of idiot working there and now we gotta make that much effort to send a thing that costs about 20‚Ç¨ to Russia. 
Also now it won‚Äôt arrive in time for her birthday anymore. 
At least we were promised to get our money back. But let‚Äôs see if they are competent enough to do that.

"You stupid sack of a huge ego and anger problems and entitlement from your life of fucking privilege. I'm in therapy. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and not refusing medication. Honestly, I fucking question if you said this with good intentions or just to imply that I'm crazy. Maybe I'm not crazy. Maybe I've just been *driven* crazy by this goddamn ""friend"" group. I mean, the double-standards and non-stop excuses to exclude me from everything. Yeah. You really expect an average person to put up with that for 7 fucking years? On top of the guilt-tripping and everything. Y' know, maybe I am a serious problem and it's mostly my fault, but you've NEVER EVER admitted even minor responsibility, and the rest of them fucking enabled you because you're not abusing them, you're abusing other people. And I guess that's what this friend-group boils down to. You all just want to ""have fun"" and ""make jokes"", usually at other people's expense, while excluding people. I happen to be easy to exclude and as you said ""extremely easy to manipulate"". So there you fucking go. Did you have your fun causing me psychological trauma over breaking my trust with personal shit over and over again and abandoning me? Did you have fun triggering major depression in your ""friend""? I swear. maybe the reason why I kept lashing out at you all near the end, is because you all were literally delighting in abusing me and making up whatever excuse to do so.  If I was abusive, it was definitely coming mutually from both sides, and a group abusing you is much more traumatizing than one single person so you can't fucking play the victim with that. I'm fucking done, I'm not going to re-initiate contact with this group EVER AGAIN. The fucked up thing is there is ZERO consequence for what any of you did, because as I said, the others don't care because it wasn't them getting abused and apparently I've been judged to be unworthy of sympathy. It'd be really fucking convenience to believe in karma now but I'm a skeptic so I realize there's no goddamn such thing and sociopaths actually succeed quite a bit in this world because they're masters of avoiding consequence. There's nothing I can do to bring about consequences, I just have to move on while your sorry ass stays completely unaware of your abusive behavior, lack of empathy, and intense anger. Meanwhile, in my fucking anger, I'm imagining someone hearing about what you did to me and choking you the fuck out. And then, after that I'm crying my fucking eyes out for hours at a time and crawling down into the fetal position because I FUCKING MISS YOU IN SPITE OF WHAT YOU DID. And I feel immense regret for lashing out at you, even if it was in fucking retaliation to the serious psychological harm you were causing. I know for a fact I feel more guilty for defending myself than you feel for nearly killing me. HOW FUCKED UP IS THAT? I fucking swear, if you could actually read this, and still felt apathetic, my hatred of you might grow so much that in that moment I might be able to actually fucking kill you. I WANT TO FORCE YOU TO FEEL A NORMAL AMOUNT OF REMORSE LIKE A HUMAN BEING FUCKING SHOULD. BUT IF YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF THAT... then why am I letting you run my fucking life with this anger?

"So a little backstory... my teacher can suck it. Both of my block teachers in middle school have been amazing, like my two fave teachers (shout-out mrs. Prasad) but for this year, I got ms. Brazil. Now she is the daughter of another teacher at our school, but contradictory to MRS. brazil, MS. Brazil is the worst teacher I have ever had. She doesn‚Äôt know how to grade, her projects don‚Äôt even let us learn, and she only cares about color. She sees a paper that has Wall Street material wording, and she gives it an f cuz there isn‚Äôt enough color.

Anyways, we had to do our quarterly boom project, and I chose to do a newspaper. My book was Enders game, and it is one of my favorite books. I decided to put extra effort into it because it is my favorite book, and my result was flawless. Ok maybe not flawless, but nonetheless very good. I put 30 minutes into it everyday for two weeks, and when I turn it in, I‚Äôm feeling happy. Btw, I had a b+so if I got a good grade, I would have an A. We get it back within about a week, and I am having a decent day. She hands it back to the class, and I look at my grade, and I immediately get depressed. I GOT A 32 OUT OF 50! I already know my moms gonna kill me when I get home, so I‚Äôm getting super depressed. She says a bit about the story‚Äôs, and says what can make it better writing. I understood what she said and I looked at my paper and thought ‚Äú ok, I see what I did wrong‚Äù then I read the line under her comments. Not newsy enough. I honest to god had to read it twice, because I was stunned. It‚Äôs a frickin newspaper, how can you say it‚Äôs too newsy. I go to her desk and ask her about it, and she says, no joke, ‚Äúthere were too many words, sit back down and do your Cornell notes‚Äù. I was steaming, but I‚Äôm a pretty insecure and shy guy, so I sit back down. I showed it to my parents after school, and they email her about it. they check their emails every day, and she hasn‚Äôt responded within two weeks. My parents are pissed, so they ask to schedule an appointment. For some reason she responds to that and says that she is busy the rest of the week, and that they have to wait till she meets with other parents, as other kids have problems with her too. I will tell you what happens after that when we meet. I hope you all enjoy this story, as this is my first reddit post, and sorry about the ranting ( again it‚Äôs my first post )",angry

"I'm not a die hard fan but lets say I watch every MCU movies within the first few released dates and I have some MCU accessories.

It was Saturday(4/27) and I was going to watch Endgame Monday(4/29) and was talking to another coworker who likes MCU movies too and will watch it soon as well. All of the sudden this other coworker who's always trying to be funny shout out spoiler #1 becuz ""a kid told her that yesterday so the kid ruined the movie for her"". I guess when your movie was ruined you'll have to ruin the movie for others too??? And the level of spoiler is like the girl is the murderer from Gone Girl, or Jack will die in Titanic. 

The next day I texted a friend of mine about the incident who was one of my closest friends bit moved to Australia. I even joked about how dumb these ppl are to spoil movie details trying to be funny but they failed. (She already watched the movie) Not more than 1s later she not only confirmed the spoiler, which I told her not to becuz I would just pretend soiler#1 might not be true cuz the coworker just heard that from a kid, but she also told me another same level of spoiler with a bit detail of that spoiler like she'll fucking get a reward for explaining more about it. 

I was beyond pissed at that point because I told her how I didn't find that coworker funny and I told her like 3 times I'm really gonna be mad if she tells me other spoilers, and she still did it anyways. I was less pissed about the coworker cuz I'm not her friend or we're not that close. I'm fucking pissed with that friend because we are, or were true friends who knew each other for a decade. 

After that I told her it ain't funny and bye felicia and she told me ""I STILL recommend you to watch it cuz it's a good movie"" I had nothing to say other than replying her ""Well you ruined it tho thanks"".

"This is all a joke. I don't even know if i am depressed or if all of this are my emotions totaly switching into hate and anger. I am very angry lately. It has been a handicape for me and for everyone aroundd me to truly commmunicate with me. 

I guess what's left is just continue living life isn't it. Because i feel like that's the only choice you have left. I just hate everything now. I am so mad at myself i can't eveen bring myself to do the work that i have to do. And it deeply sucks. I don't even know if i need help or if i just don't and its all a amatter of life until it fades away. 

To be honest i think instead of doing actual stuff i just spoil myself into not doing it and just doing whatever i want.",angry

I dont know why bit I'm just so angry. I feel so easily irritated. All I wanna do is either cut myself or punch something. Unfortunately I cant do that because it bad. I agree that it's bad and I shouldn't do either activity but still want to. Like fuck.

"Hello everyone, I really feel like I'm having an extreme breakdown right now. I want to send this text to a friend who used to be close but seems somewhat distant. This is the text where I think I say everything that I want to say. But I can't send the text because I'm extremely unsure if that would be best. But I really do need an outlet right not and I will pray/wish/want all the best for anyone. I appreciate it if you read it but you really don't have to. I apologize for the length. Also, when I am really emotional, it's very difficult to give your context. Just to inform.

] ""So I've been told that I just come here smoke your weed and leave, honestly this, too be frank this really frustrates me to hear. There is so much hypocrisy, it really boils my blood. Look, everything that happened happened. I'm not right and neither are you. I heard all of your point of view and somethings I agree with. Me throwing a tantrum and acting ""passive aggressive"" even though it's very obvious how I feel, especially the fact that I cried afterwards and you know how I took things. I was really fine with everything, until the whole fucking stupid coming up and smoking your weed thing was heard and that really pushed me to another level of pissed off. Apparently I'm just hogging all your weed. And EVERYTIME I tense this world EVERYTIME I come up to you I leave a mess. You know how conscious I was to make sure I don't do that? It was something I always tried to make sure I didn't do. Until I realized that you were leaving your stuff over and you were not giving me the same respect that I was giving you. I don't know if you assumed it was fine because our place wasn't the most tidy or not but at the time I still thought it wasn't okay because you were adding to it. But here is where I went wrong and I am not petty enough to admit it. I cared less for your hygiene of your apartment instead of confronting you about how your actions frustrated me. And not forget that when I went up to your apartment, you initially kept denying that you left anything at my place until I kept pushing on how you actually did. I had to give you examples for you to believe me. Then I hear that you stopped doing it because you found out Andrew picked it up? You realize how much lying that is? I'm not even sure if you're aware of it or not but I'm so frustrated with it. I don't want to put up with any of it anymore. I like to see things as objectively as possible despite my strong emotions regarding this whole dumb ass petty situation. I try to stay forgiving but this is getting really fucking ridiculous. You understand some things, but not in the big scheme of things. I'm avoiding this because I see your anger to be extremely irrelevant to the situation objectively. I tried to emphasize with your anger and I'll always respect the way you feel. But when alot of times, at the moment you understand but I hear some stuff that is not the truth. That makes me furious. I want to approach everything diplomatically and with love and compassion but it's so hard when you really don't consider how I feel about you actions and you don't really put much thought into how things affect me and also who I live with. This is between you and me, but I'm not mad about that. It just frustrated me when D was with you on ""smoking your weed then leaving"". This feels extremely ridiculous and superficial. I might be making something big out of a small petty ass situation. But the only reason main reason why I'm reacting like this is because I feel like you never consider how I feel alot of times. You think I throw tantrums now because of that buildup over time then reacting to how easily it is for you to give me a hard time. It breaks my heart B. It really fucking does. I was not mad, but I was turned off by how you've been treating me. But now I'm mad again for hearing this. But not just mad, but also really sad. I acknowledge the wrongs on my side but honestly you think that you're more right than me which makes it so hard to talk to you about this shit. This has a core message, all these details are here because of my perception of your behavior. I wanted to take the high road and send you a heartfelt message that was genuine. But it's really fucking frustrated when I could say you're probably talking shit about me to other people. I don't appreciate that at all. It really hurts. I'm not blaming you for anything in an overall sense. I know I did wrong things. But one last time. You have alot of wrong in this just like how I had wrong. Respect. Please.""

To be positive though,
This really encouraged me to actually respect how I feel more. It is a lesson and I want to try to keep it like that. But It still is heartbreaking. 

Thank you and all the best,",angry

"Here's to you, my loving girlfriend. No use in hiding because you're going to stalk this account and read it anyways because you don't know the freakin' meaning of privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

I know things are tough because the house is breaking down (really, it's only our bathroom because the contractors who worked on it were fucking shitheads and my family wanted to keep costs low) but we're already making plans to fix it so it won't happen next time.

&amp;#x200B;

The house has 3 bathrooms, use the other 2! Jesus.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you do yourself the favour of not being a bitch about it? I get it, you like bathing in our bathroom and not in the other ones, but Jesus Christ you're 24 fucking years old. Grow up and just do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do you react so badly to it or to anything in this house? You may live in it but you're not even the one paying for it the repairs, materials, or labor. Lucky for us, we didn't have to pay for this house, my family just lent it to us. You don't even pay rent like the other tenants do because you have lucky position of being my SO.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do you always make things so much harder than they have to be? Just bathe or shit the other bathrooms. God. No Bucket? Get one down stairs. No hand-pail? Get one down stairs. No Bidet? Jesus Christ use toilet paper or wash your ass with water

"Sorry for this rant. I need to vent or I am going to go crazy.   
I hate this fucking bitch and what I hate even more is that I get so upset about her. This worthless piece of trash shouldn't have such power over me.   
She has this health problem and that is of course tragic, but I just FUCKING HATE IT when people try to make a living off other people's pity and constantly instrumentalize their ailments to get their way and manipulate others. This skank thinks she can get away with absolutely EVERYTHING because she has a moderate heart condition. Since when does having a heart condition give you the right to behave like an absolute fucking MONSTER? Since the day I met her, she has been constantly whining about how she is basically ""dying"", and yet there she is, out and about, drinking cocktails, eating junk food three days a week, and of course she never has to pay for herself because she is such a poor, poor sick little puppy and can't be expected to even pay for her own fucking sandwich. She's been ""dying"" for three years and yet she still looks and moves and behaves exactly the same - well, after a while, it gets kind of suspicious! That piece of trash really reminds me of a woman I saw on Forensic Files who manipulated people with a fake pregnancy - well, who would've thought that after claiming to be pregnant for 24 months with no baby in sight people might get suspicious. Ever heard of Munchhausen Syndrome, you retard?",angry
So this kid at my school spoild endgame for me and I was in the middle of a piss while he said it.

YOU RUIN A FILM FOR SOME ONE WHO THOUGHT TO MABY GO SEE IT AND TWO PEOEPLE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN IT AND YOU JUST SAY SORRY

"No, he‚Äôs not a mind reader. Yes, I have told him I would like him to do this. Does he do it? No. Does he get mad when I get annoyed that he didn‚Äôt do it? Yes.

You lay in bed alllllll day every fucking Saturday. You make excuses saying you work on homework, but guess what fucker? I‚Äôm in school and working full time too!!!! You‚Äôre not special and it doesn‚Äôt excuse your laziness!

"One of the things in life that makes me the most angry/sad. I can't believe people still do it. If you want to risk your own health, that's your own problem, but don't force that problem on innocent kids who won't be able to understand or control the effects it has on them until it's too late. Don't have a cigarette if you're out and about with your kid and they have to stay near you. If you're going to go out for a smoke, go out to an area where it won't travel back inside your living quarters. Come back, wash your hands, ideally change your clothes. And for the love of God nobody in this day and age should be smoking cigarettes inside. 

Maybe the precautions seem extreme and unnecessary to frequent smokers, but SO IS A CHILD DEVELOPING A DISORDER/DISEASE THAT THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO DESERVE",angry

"Something happened and I need advice ASAP. So this happened with my girlfriend, we‚Äôve been together for more than a year and this girl, I gotta tell you she‚Äôs perfect to me. Shes so worth it for anything and there‚Äôs nothing more that I want than a future with her. Anyways, we were chilling at her place and I changed shirts in front of her but she noticed 2 red marks on my chest. She instantly assumed it was hickies that someone else gave me. I would never and never have, cheated, I‚Äôm am morally strict with cheating, and I would never cheat. Anyways, even I didnt notice them b4 so the only things I thought that they could be are marks of dumbells hitting there when I curl cuz they could hit there on accident. I got freaked out bc she kept telling me to get out, calling me a f*cking cheater, etc. I know that if I walked out she would not answer any of my calls and never believe that I‚Äôm not a cheater. I admit myself, I did start crying a lot and being frantic. After a while she kept budging and budging that I cheated, when I would never. I thought since she cussed at me I thought I could too bc I was so frustrated and hurt. I raised my voice(not yelled) and I told her 2 times ‚Äúfucking believe me now.‚Äù She looked at me in a way I‚Äôve never seen before. Then she told me that now she remembers she gave me those marks(theyre not hits) a couple days ago. But she said she was so hurt with me for how I answered. I explained that I was hurt and frustrated and that she told me stuff too but she told me that she‚Äôs scared of me now. I regret it so much. She said she saw a side of me she had never seen and she cried in a way I‚Äôve never seen her cry. I hate myself for what I did. Idk what to say or do so she doesnt leave me and for her to forgive me. I don‚Äôt want her to be scared of me, like she knows I would never have hit her or something, but she says that she‚Äôs still scared of me:(",angry

"So obviously I'm going to love my cousin because she's family and she hasn't really done anything personally to me. But for fucks sake does she get on my nerves. She's one of those edgy kids who posts selfies with some sort of ""deep"" caption and what not. Anyways, she's the artist of the family, and I'm the musician. I'm an alright student, I used to get a couple of D's and C's here and there but I've really picked myself up this year :). Going on, she just said to me, ""I'm joining chorus next year, what should I know?"" And I'm going to give her the god honest advice. Chorus in my school is hard work. You have to be dedicated, which she is not. She fails a lot of her classes, has NO worth ethic what so ever, and just overall annoying. I said to her ""you have to know music"". She said ""the notes or the lyrics?"", Obviously I said both. She has the AUDACITY TO SAY ""ouch, okay"" AS IF I WAS BEING RUDE?! I was just telling her she can't be the lazy shit head she is if she wants to actually do chorus. And I don't wanna be a total asshole, but I've heard her sing. To which she can't. I'm not saying I'm any Beyonce or Madonna but I know how to sing notes correctly. I'm not tone deaf. I won't be in chorus next year so it won't be my problem, but I care for my choral director, and don't want her to piss him off any more than the other shit heads do. I'm just fed up with her trying to do things knowing she won't have any work ethic and just waste other people's time.",angry

Seriously. When people vaccine, they are not just protecting themselves against a disease, but they are also creating ""herd immunity"" in which they protect others from a disease.

"What in the actual fuck is wrong with this and why doesn't it work???? I hate how nothing ever works right and everything takes literally 20-100x longer to debug if it ever ends up working at all. Object oriented stuff is great, I've got all kinds of projects going on and write random widgets for fun, but web dev sucks because it 100% doesn't make any sense at all and is worse than trying to type an essay while blindfolded on a half German half French keyboard that is also flipped upside down and has half of the keys missing.

Documentation basically doesn't exist and too many libraries are deprecated so it is really fucking hard to do anything at all. The usual ""just Google it"" doesn't work because most of the stuff you find is useless, or requires tons of annoying accommodations to work. I've had very little sleep and food and at least 4 caffeine pills everyday for the past 2 weeks so everything is absolute hell and I really don't want to be dealing with this bullshit right now, but as usual web dev is here to ruin my day and make everything worse.",angry

"like why the fuck is dark mode this complicated some websites and apps support it but some don't and then you have both light and dark which is not ideal, it doesn't match up this fucking dark mode trend sucks I hate how there is this stigma around dark mode created by snobby egostistical neckbeards who think that having a different colored background and white text makes them superior well it fucking doesn't

you know what I spent so much time trying to replicate the dark mode environment just now I spent at least 30 minutes and it was worth nothing I was trying to get google discover feed to show dark mode but it wasn't so I uninstalled and reinstalled the google app and that fucking sucked because I feel like that the app wouldn't be as functional now that I've uninstalled and reinstalled it (I had to do it twice too the fucking fucker) like why tho and quickstep launcher doesn't even support dark mode discovery feed I miss Nova but Nova was clunky as fuck

Why the fuck do I even care about these things or the order in which icons are placed on my home screen or in my start menu I've spent more than 10 hours designing custom icons for my apps like why the fuck you nerd

"Sorry for the messy description about boring administration stuff that is about to follow.

Tomorrow I was supposed to collect an important document from an office in order to enroll in a Master's program at university. I could only collect it tomorrow because a) the process to acquire it was delayed due to the illness of one of my examiners, and b) the enrollment deadline is tomorrow. 

So, I talked to the person in that office which I need to collect that document from, explained my problem and we specifically arranged that I could come tomorrow to get that document, which was cool.

And only now do I see the online announcement (can't be older than one or two days), that this whole office will be closed tomorrow, which means that I can not enroll in the program. 

Of course I am aware that the office could be closed for all kinds of emergency reasons, and I am not blaming anyone, but I'm still angry and sad. I put a lot of work into the application and enrollment process, and I feel bad for hassling so many admin and uni people to please please please hurry up with testimonials, certificates etc., and now, at the very end of this whole process, it turns out it was for nothing.

"I've been harboring this anger for a long time. I. AM. NOT. A. BAD. PERSON. I do not do bad things. I am, however, insecure, emotional, irrational at times, but mostly I am human. I am still mad at you, two years later, I am still mad at you. Not because you were some amazing person that only comes along once in a lifetime, don't flatter yourself. I am still mad at you because you took away every OUNCE of happiness you gave and then some. Don't ever fall in love, don't ever tell yourself that the time spent together is worth the pain if it's lost. Don't do it. Whoever said ""It's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all,"" clearly never had their heart ripped out, never had the world reveal it's cruel intentions, never had a person who claimed to be a good christian tell you you weren't good enough because you don't know what you believe in. ""You have all the traits of a good christian, without the faith."" ""I need to be around good christians, like my parents."" These, the words of a 36 year old man who was going to have to move back in with his parents because he wouldn't find extra work or get a full time job because my full time job couldn't support every single bill we had. The man who said ""My parents said I can't have any contact with you."" THIRTY SIX. The same man who used his depression as a personality trait, refused to take his medication, believed God would heal every little problem or make money magically appear if we just prayed, and lives in the same medicated/unmedicated cycle every few months. SO MANY people suffer from depression and are so silent about the battle, it is a huge part of who you are, but most do not expect the entire world to cater to their every need, to be the center of attention. I'm not sure of my faith because I was raised in two, it's not fair to ask me to choose if you never wanted to go to church. For someone of such a strong faith, I never saw you in a church, never saw you pray. I remember the look you had, when you'd said everything you had to say about why we were breaking up, then realized that we would be paid the day rent was due and could make it another month, I remember the look on your face when you said ""A big part of me still wants to make this work here"" as though you had no idea of the damage you had already done. The look you had when I told you that was long gone, that you don't get to break me and then take it back. When ending it with me was easier than just finding another place to live, because breaking up with me was easier than telling your parents about me. You always said that our age gap was such an issue, because I was 25, but clearly you were right, you weren't adult enough for me. Karma will get you one day.",angry

I'm sorry, I genuinely have a hate for cancer cells.

Also, did you know that if you went down to the microscopic level, you could literally fuck things to death? It's true. Bacteria and Viruses only have a paper thin layer of viscous jelly-like fluid protecting their innards. We have many cells protecting our innards, and these cells are amazing at their job.

After after an hour or so I asked my cousin if she wasn't hot, which she replied yes, I later proceed to turn on the air conditioning, and it seems like my aunt heard me from the other department (cause I said it pretty loud I guess??) and she was like, turn on the air conditioner then, and I said that's what I did. Then she and my uncle said; as if they are talking to each other but loud enough for me to hear that they were talking about me (their desks are quite close to each other) they said thst I was so lazy and/or that I was so lazy that i even forgot to turn on the air conditioner and things like that.

I'm enraged that I can't talk about my best friend who's Ecuadorian without him being claimed by others as my ""token"" friend, despite us being best buds for twelve years. 

Most of all, I'm incredibly angry about how I can't take pride in my anscestors culture or accomplishments without it being flagged as racists. I'm Celtic, and I think it's important to recognize the Vikings accomplishments and I take pride in my warrior anscestors, and it kills my soul for that to be shut down by everyone around me based on the fact that we happened to be further away from the equator than them.

"I‚Äôm so angry and need to get this rant off of my chest.

I am going to start by saying I‚Äôm a younger female and work at a restaurant in nyc. I got off about 2am. I went next door to my after work bar where other industry ‚Äúfriends‚Äù go when they get off work as well. 

I left around 3:30am. I go down to the subway to catch my train home and there is a guy, early 20‚Äôs, passed out on the ground before the subway turnstiles with his keys and credit cards scattered all around him. I pick up his belonging and try to wake him up asking if he is okay. He is mumbling a little bit and I can‚Äôt understand him. So I go to one of the MTA kiosks and call the emergency help button. The man on the other end says help will arrive shortly. So I keep trying to get this guy to wake up. He finally sits up and give him the water if bought myself. He tells me his name and where he is from. And that‚Äôs all he really know as. He doesn‚Äôt know where in ny he is staying, why he‚Äôs here or if he has friends here. But the poor kid  guy keeps complaining that his ass hurts.

About 45 minutes go by and no one has came. No police, no mta and no paramedics. One guy who‚Äôs been watching us from the stairs comes over finally and asks if he can sit with us while he waits for his train. I thought maybe he felt sympathetic to the whole situation and wanted to help me out and maybe help the guy I‚Äôm trying to help feel more comfortable.. instead he starts hitting on me. I couldn‚Äôt believe this. The creep finally leaves and to my luck, I think, my manager from my restaurant walks passed us, sees the situation and asks if I‚Äôm okay. I start explaining to him about what‚Äôs going on with this guy and how I found him passed out with his credit cards all around him and my manager cuts me off and says ‚ÄúI asked if YOU were okay, not him‚Äù. I say I‚Äôm fine and my manager walks away saying he‚Äôs going to get his train.

At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do. I gave the guy my jacket because he kept saying how cold he was. 

About an hour has passed and a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù from the bar I was at sees me. He listens to the situation and goes upstairs to find police and brings them down. The police start talking to the guy and say I can leave. My friend offers to split a cab with me since it‚Äôs now very late and I‚Äôm exhausted. 
 
On our cab ride home my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù proceeded to hit on me asking for bj‚Äôs and hj‚Äôs the whole way. I kept saying ‚Äúno!‚Äù and he got so angry naming every person he could think of that ‚Äúhe knows I did stuff with‚Äù, saying I must not like him as much. Obviously our friendship is over. 

But I just want to ask WTF IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE?! This whole situation sucked, and I‚Äôm so angry with everyone who didn‚Äôt help me or the guy I was trying to help.

"Sorry for the bad formatting, I am on mobile and I am also translating this story  from my native language which is french.



So a little of background so you can all understand. 
I am 12 years old and I am going back home from my school in a subway. I am whit my friends (about 4 of em) and I am about 4,2 foot tall and about 75 pounds. We are in Quebec were everyone speak French and also have an accent and a weird way of talking.(like &lt;Kalisse,Tabarnak, ect.)

So now lets get into the story. 
Me and my friends are talking and laughing and one of my friend (about 12 years old) step on one guys foot (he was in his mid 20)(reminder: we are in Quebec and the guy is from France and we can clearly hear that when he talking 

This is how the conversation went :

Me: me‚Äî- Friend= F‚Äî‚Äî- Stupid guy= sg‚Äî‚Äî-
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

SG - Hey ! Watch out were you are going... at least say sorry !! (His tone keep getting higher)

F - ho sorry.

SG - Your parents did not teach you manner ? 

(I was getting triggered because he was welling at my   12  YEARS OLD FRIEND 

Me - yo, He is just a kid, calm down

He now is getting out the the subway and he say:

SG - Freaking  People from Quebec (remember, I am. Translating so it does to sound as good as it di xd)

Me - F-you F-ing morron.

And there it is. I know I should have not said all these words at the end and I acted immature but I was triggered and I think I probably have anger issues so yea...‚Äô

Thanks for reading !

"Why is it that I am regularly praised by my female peers (College) for my looks, and how well I supposedly treat them, but whenever I ask one out she has no desire. Like really? You guys practically follow me around and have no desire to be exclusive? And yet you'll give me a ""favor"" between classes?

What really bothers me is how they come to me about how their crush rejected them even though they were fucking some other guy the week before!

At this point I can't even fathom dating anyone now or when I graduate because deep down I know these girls ain't loyal. Does this not anger anyone else? Like even the girls that are fives and lower are doing this crap...

It sucks cause I personally am very traditional despite not growing up in that environment and it is frustrating to see that everyone would rather sleep around than have something meaningful.",angry
"Constantly praised by my female peers for my looks, kindness, and just things I do in general but none will date. More often than not they'll hook up then ghost like I won't see them in class the next day.

"If any one reads this, I'm impressed.

Tldr; many examples of why life is totally exhausting and feels like it will never end. Constant managing of other people's time and effort seem fruitless because sometimes the people (a) don't care or (b) might actually be that dumb. Exhausted and uncertain of how to move forward because of all personal and professional effort without giving myself a cornucopia of health and mood related problems in the... probably not so distant future. 

1- At my job , I am a glorified babysitter. A lot of it is fixing other peoples mistakes (at companies DON'T work for) so I can pass the information to the boss. Didn't do that once as a test and shit hit the fan... so... I went back to doing other peoples work because they are assholes.

2- At my job, I am a glorified babysitter because I do two things ALL the time: (a) did you do project x yet that? It's due Monday the 00/00 (even with ludicrously easy follow up emails or reminders a 2 year old could understand that I need a COMPLETE doc/pdf/report in order to move forward) and then having to follow up with them for NOT having done it (ü§®) or (b) excessive hand holding when you already told your boss how to do something for the 3rd time. (üôÑ)

3- Had to FUCKING bust ass and work three times as hard to be a full time student, full time employee, find a grant to pay for my thesis research because parents suck. Btw, honors earned, and 3.9 gpa... When I say I that, it's not out of a natural gift, only more proof that I work HARD. 

4- Had to bust ass to be treated with respect with a fucking psycho roommate. Efforts were futile so I moved- but still had TO FIGHT for any kind of privacy or civility in the interim. 

5- FIGHT with words against cops who wouldn't believe I was sexually harassed. 

6- FIGHT to decrease my rent because the landlord did not prepare for my arrival (even though he was given over 30 days notice) so that it was prorate it because I could not habitate that apartment. 

7- FIGHT against the car repair place and tried to negotiate better cost for unexpected repair. 

8- FiGHTING for enough time to study and workout as they are of the utmost importance. Hand holding will not be my permanent profession and I plan to get out ASAP, and get my Masters. 

9- Usual fighting with doctors about a chronic problem I've had. 

I'm fucking exhausted. Can I really count on no one? If this is life, I want to walk out if it, put my hands up, and say I quit. I'm so done with the laziness of other people, the selfishness of people not respecting others, and the general FIGHT mode I feel like I have to be in to make it in this world, and to not be tricked by companies. Just thinking about other people relaxing on a beach makes me irritaionally angry because my first thought is: are you the fuckwad that took 3 months to figure out how an invoice worked or the fuckwad who doesn't know how to accept a report by clicking a goddamn button?

The house is cluttered and messy and the sun comes in weird so it's unsettling and there's nowhere to be still or comfortable. There's not one room that blocks the noise of the games or the neighbors lawn mowers or dogs or the shitty too loud cars.

"So I moved into a house with a couple of college friends last year. It was for four people but we had five just to make it easier on rent because we were all broke college kids. Long story short I didn't like that college at all and I do not go there anymore, so I moved out.

When I moved out a friend of my ex roommates moved into my room and he also took over my payments. It all worked out great because my ex roommates payed the same amount, there wasn't an empty room, and I no longer had to pay rent anymore. 

About 3 months later, I am moving into a new apartment with a friend and everything is going good. I get a call from one of my old roommates... He told me that the guy that moved into my room just left out of no where. They came home one day and his room was empty, he moved out with no warning! 

Like I stated earlier we're all broke college kids and don't have a lot of money. And none of them have the extra $300 to split for the missing person. Also the guy that lefts name isn't on the lease so there's literally nothing we can do.

"So towards the end of February, me and my gf (honestly dont even know if we or aren't legitimately) hit a huge wall in our relationship. She caught me talking to someone, told her mom and cousin and somehow managed to convince to leave me and move to Florida with her dad. So somewhere mid day, she texts while I'm at work need to talk later, so I'm like nah just tell me now if its important. (Had a feeling where it was going but I needed to hear what she had to say.) So she's sending me paragraphs on how she's done with me and all this crap. About a day or two later she's telling me she doesn't actually want leave me and she wants to work things out but she's still moving to Florida. Well a week before she leaves while I'm work she goes chill with some guy she been talking talking to for a week while trying to make it work with me. I didn't find out till a few days she left because her cousin texted ""how was it with that guy"". So i start going thru her phone and she has his # saved with no name just the #. That's when I learned she had been talking to him and asked her about and she lied to my fucking face. So a few days before she leaves I catch her texting someone else. So were still trying to work this out, cause ik k was in the wrong first and I'm not a hypocrite. Well before she leaves we agree on being friends for the meanwhile like a month or so, so that were not at each others necks and can figure out mentally what we need to do to be better for each other. We both said it was ok talk to whom ever you please. I gave her permission to snoop thru my shit as long as she doesn't make me feel bad about it or give me shit, well it's only been like three weeks and here we are, telling ""how can I be talking to other people (only 2 people) it hasn't been that long i dont miss her the way she does and that i dont want to be with her and all this crap but she still loves me but she's really ready to leave that I'm not trying to even be with her again."" I personally just wanted to relax and not worry about a relationship so that I can not stress and figure out what I want to do with myself and where I want to be and how to get there what not. But she for some reason rather be stuck on the past and me rather than trying to forward for herself and get her shit together. We'd been together for almost 4 years. For 3 of the years I supported her, 2 cats and a dog financially because she couldn't and choose not keep a steady job. She was back n forth to Florida with her dad staying a month every time she went. She even moved back in with her mom for like month to try and get her shit together and I supported her and she gave up and came back to being sheltered by me. At first I didn't mind we were kids we didn't have much going for us but what we had spiritually was out of this world. Towards the end of year 2 early 3 I did talk to someone else whom she found about. But in my defense even though I know it was wrong it was because I felt like she wasnt committed to growing and actually trying to work for actual life so that we can be on our own so I did get bored and felt a bit lonely even though I knew she loved me. 

We first got together when we 16/17 we are now about to be 21. I don't want to give up but she gets under my skin with her way of handling things and I personally dont know what to do anymore.",angry

I‚Äôm only 14 and ever since I was 8 I had an idea of why do we need all these powerful consoles if we could just have one huge server and computers that compute everything for us then we just stream it and control that stream. So basically what they just cane up with. I had those exact details on mind as well. So I‚Äôm kinda angry that I didn‚Äôt have the resources to do anything about it. I think I told some people a long time ago but have t brought it up. The only thing that sort of reminded me of it was when Microsoft released windows ten and you could stream it onto your pc. When they did that I was like yea like that but instead of my home WiFi they use there own Computers. Idk just a cool thought.,angry
